# nasin toki pona—a good way to speak
*by jan Juli (kili pan Juli / cile pa n-Ile)*

In this document I aim to provide a comprehensive grammar of toki pona.
Since toki pona is a very personal language, this document reflects my own **opinions** and **style decisions**.
That said, nothing about this `nasin toki` is unusual.
If you follow this grammar, you will be well understood by most (if not all) toki pona speakers.

[toki pona](https://www.tokipona.org/) was created by Sonja Lang. My thanks and love, jan Sonja o! 💚

# basics

## how to read this grammar
- Throughout this document, I will use
  - single capital letters (e.g. `X`) to represent any valid toki pona [*content word*](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#content-words) or [*phrase*](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#phrases)
  - `<prep>` to refer to any of the [*prepositions*](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#prepositions)
  - `<preverb>` to refer to any of the [*preverbs*](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#preverbs)
- Code-blocks contain valid toki pona (when replacing the above-mentioned abbreviations with real words).
Brackets mark the bracketed part as optional, e.g. `toki [ni] li pona`
- All translations are **only suggestions**.
Since toki pona is highly **context-sensitive**, there is never only a single valid interpretation of a given sentence.


## general principles
When using toki pona, it can help to keep in mind these general principles.

### implied politeness
There is no need for formalities like "please" and "thank you" in toki pona.
Generally, politeness is assumed per default.
That doesn't mean you can't tell someone what you are thankful for, though.
Instead of using empty formulaic ways to thank people, tell them why and how you are thankful, or that they are good!

### no sentence internal recursion
In many natural languages we can embed whole sentences into other sentences.
For example, we do this in English when building relative clauses.
In the sentence "I see people who walk to the house.", the relative clause is "who walk to the house", which is basically a complete sentence on its own.
In toki pona, these things are split up into multiple sentences:
`mi lukin e jan ni: ona li tawa tomo`

### no single word for "and"
To say "and", instead repeat the appropriate particle (cf. the [section on how to say "and"](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#how-to-say-and)).


## word types
This sections lists the types of words in toki pona.
Some people might analyze certain things differently.
Importantly, when these word types are mentioned in this document, the corresponding words listed here are what is referred to.

### particles
*Particles* are usually small words that only or primarily have grammatical functions.
For usage details, see the respective sections on the particles in the [in-depth part](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#in-depth).

#### pure particles
`en`, `li`, `e`, `la`, `pi`, `o`

*Pure particles* are words that have no semantic meaning on their own.
They are purely grammatical words that exist to mark parts of speech, context, and modifier-order.

#### emoticle
`a`

The word `a` does not fit well into the other categories and thus gets its own place here as the *emoticle* (a portmanteu of emotion and particle).
It is used to add emotional emphasis to words, phrases, or whole sentences.

### pseudo-particles
`nanpa`, `kin`, `ala`, `taso`, `anu`

The *pseudo-particles* are words that have particle-like properties, but can sometimes also be used as content-words.
They are therefore listed as their own category.
As with the particles, check their respective sections in the [in-depth part](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#in-depth) for more details.

### content words
Literally every other word in toki pona is a *content word* with semantic meaning attached.
Every content word can work like all of what is called "adjective", "adverb", "verb", "noun" in English.
Some of these are part of special groupings that give them additional grammatical functions.
All the words that aren't mentioned in this section are pure content words.

#### pronouns
`mi`, `sina`, `ona`, `ni`

The *pronouns*, like all content words in toki pona, are *both* singular and plural (quite like the English "you").

#### prepositions
`lon`, `tawa`, `tan`, `sama`, `kepeken`

*Prepositions* are used to further describe the manner of the predicate.
They indicate information about where, whither, whence, how, or whereby the predicate is performed.

#### preverbs
(pu) `wile`, `sona`, `awen`, `kama`, `ken`, `lukin`  
(popular usage) `open`, `pini`, `alasa`

The *preverbs* are special words that can change the meaning of the predicate in ways normal modifiers cannot.
Unlike all other modification in toki pona, they occur *before* the predicate they are applied to.

#### question word
`seme`

The *question word* `seme` behaves like a content word from a grammatical point of view.
Importantly, that means that unlike in various natural languages, it cannot be used as a relative pronoun.


## sentence structure
A basic toki pona sentence looks like this:

`X li Y [e Z]`[^li-dropping]

(more complex sentence structures are of course possible, if necessary (e.g. [here](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#combining-different-conjunctions)))

[^li-dropping]: Whenever our main character, the subject `X` is exactly the word `mi` (and nothing else) or exactly the word `sina` (and nothing else), the particle `li` is dropped from the sentence.
  Examples:
  *only* `mi`: `mi lukin e ona` - "I see them.";
  *not only* `mi`: `tomo mi li lili` - "My house is small."
  
Example:  
`soweli li moku e kili` - "An animal eats fruit."

#### the subject
- `X` is the main character of our sentence, the **subject**
  - It can be a person, a thing, an idea, anything really
  - The important part is that our sentence describes what `X` is or is doing
#### the predicate
- `Y` is this thing they are or are doing, the **predicate**
  - It can be an action; like working, playing, talking
  - ... a description; like blue, good, tall
  - ... or a thing; like house, animal, food
#### the direct object - `Z` is the thing that the action is done to, the **direct object**
  - it can also be basically anything
  - it is either the reciever of the action `Y` performed by `X`, e.g `soweli li pali e tomo` ~ "The animal builds a nest."
  - ... or the stimulus that `X` experiences through doing `Y`, e.g. `soweli li lukin e kili` ~ "The animal sees a fruit."


## phrases
Since toki pona has a very minimalist lexicon, all the content words cover broad semantic fields.
To specify what we are talking about, we can build *phrases*.  
A phrase consists of a main content word, the **head**, and zero or more additional content words, the **modifier(s)**.

The head is the main thing we are talking about, while the modifiers further specify the head's (usually very broad) semantic field.
We can always remove any modifiers from a given phrase without changing that it *could* refer to the same thing as before, but it becomes less specific by doing so.

Example:  
In `tomo waso` ("bird-house"), the word `tomo` is the head while `waso` modifies it.
We are talking first and foremost about a `tomo`.
The modifier tells us that the `tomo` is in some way related to the semantic field of `waso`.

### multiple modifiers
If multiple modifiers are present they all apply to the head of the phrase.
We can simply append modifiers like `X Y Z` is an `X` that is related to `Y` and to `Z`
The order in which modifiers is not strictly important, but it can be used to highlight the earlier modifiers.

Examples:  
`soweli suli pimeja` - "dark big animal"
`jan lawa pona` - "good leader"

### the particle `pi`
To modify the head of one phrase with another phrase instead of a single content word, we precede that second phrase with `pi`.

Example:  
`poki pi telo wawa` - "strong-liquid container", e.g. a cup of coffee, but  
`poki telo wawa` - "strong liquid-container", e.g. a diamond bottle

### no objects in phrases
Generally, objects cannot be part of phrases.
They are a kind of recursion that is usually not done in toki pona.[^objects-in-phrases]

[^objects-in-phrases]: While this is universally true for direct objects (marked with `e`), some people do use indirect, prepositional objects in phrases.
  I personally avoid such constructions, since I dislike a few things about them.  
  (1) Their usage makes it hard to use prepositions in their content-word versions in phrases.  
  (2) They can often be expressed by removing the preposition (if a single word is floowing it)
  or replacing the preposition with `pi` (if multiple words are following).  
  (3) They, like all other kinds of objects, lead to recursions that I do not consider *pona.*


## how to use prepositions
[Prepositions](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#prepositions) are generally used to mark different kinds of indirect objects.
They can be used in two ways.
They are either appended to the predicate they modify or come directly after `li` in predicate-less sentences.  
- `X li Y <prep> Z`
- `X li <prep> Y`

Example:  
`kasi li suli tan wawa suno` - "The plants are big because of the sun's power."  
`ona li kepeken ilo` - "They use tools." (lit. "They, using tools.")  
`mi sama sina` - "I am like you." (lit. "I, like you.")  
Note that while these last two literal constuctions are not valid in English, it is so in other languages such as Russian and toki pona.


## how to use preverbs
The [preverbs](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#preverbs) are used to change the semantic field in ways that simple modifiers cannot.
They are simple added *in front of* the predicate they are applied to.

`X li <preverb> Y [e Z]`

Note that the direct object (here `Z`) relates to the predicate (here `Y`) and *not* to the preverb.


## how to say "and"
The word "and" has no translation in toki pona.
Instead, a general rule is to just repeat the appropriate particle to form conjunctions.

#### multiple subjects
To combine different phrases into a subject, we use the word `en`.

`X en Y li Z`  
`A en B en C li D`

#### multiple predicates
To say that a subject `X` is doing two things, `Y` and `Z` we just repeat the predicate marker `li` like so:

`X li Y li Z`

If the subject is `mi` or `sina`, we just leave out the first `li` as usual, but still use it for any following predicates.[^pu-note-mi-sina]

[^pu-note-mi-sina]: In *pu*, this is disallowed.
  Instead, it suggests starting a new sentence for each predicate: `mi X. mi Y. mi Z.`

`mi X li Y li Z`

#### multiple direct objects
To add multiple objects, just repeat the particle `e`.

`A li B e C e D`

#### multiple prepositional phrases
We can also add multiple prepositional phrases to a sentence.

`A li B <prep> C <prep> D`  

Here are some examples of how to say or not say "and" in prepositional contexts:  
`waso li musi kepeken wawa kepeken kon` - "Birds play using power and air."  
`jan Pin li sama jan Po li sama jan Kiko.` - "Finn is like Bob and like Rico." (Note the additional `li`.)  
`jan Pin li sama jan Po sama jan Kiko.` - "Finn, like Rico, is like Bob.", but arguably also "Finn is like Bob and like Rico.".
To reduce ambiguity we should always add the second `li` in case the first version is intended.

#### combining different conjunctions
When multiple predicates are present, it can be ambiguous which predicate(s) the object(s) and preposition(s) apply to.

Example:  
`jan li pali li pakala e tomo e ilo lon ma kepeken luka`  
Note how this ambiguity is also present in English:
"The person builds and breaks houses and tools in the field by means of their hands."

We can often resolve the ambiguity by restructuring, depending on what is really meant:
`jan li pali e tomo lon ma li pakala e ilo kepeken luka` ("The person builds a house in the field and breaks tools using their hands.")
`jan li pali e tomo e ilo kepeken luka li pakala e ona lon ma` ("The person builds houses and tools using their hands and breaks them in the field.")


## questions
There are three different ways to build a question.

### `X ala X`
This construction is used for simple yes-or-no questions: `Y li X ala X`
It asks the listener whether the sentence `Y li X` is true.  
To answer an `X ala X` question, simply repeat the predicate for yes (`X`) or the predicate followed by `ala` for "no" (`X ala`).
Of course it is always possible to answer in a full sentence instead.

Example:  
`soweli loje li moku ala moku e kili` - "Do foxes eat vegetables?"  
`moku ala` - "No."

Special cases:
- If there is a [preverb](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#preverbs) before the predicate, apply `X ala X` to the preverb instead of the main-predicate,
  e.g. `kili li kama ala kama suli` ("Did the fruit grow big?").
- If the predicate is a [phrase](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#phrases), you may just repeat the head,
  e.g. `jan li pana ala pana pi wawa mute e sike` ("Does the person yeet the ball?").
- To stress what you are asking for, you can also `X ala X` other parts of the sentence,
  e.g. `soweli ala soweli li nasin e sina` ("Did an *animal* lead you?")

### `anu seme`
The second way to ask a yes-or-no question is `X li Y anu seme`.
This is not much different from the first, but it suggests a less simple answer than just "yes" or "no" may be expected.
It is answered the same way as the `X ala X` question.

Example:  
`ma sina li lete anu seme` - "Is it cold where you are?"  
`lete. taso suno pini li seli a` - "Yes, but yesterday it was very warm!"

### `seme`
If we replace the thing that is asked for with `seme`, we can ask an open question.
Using this construction, we ask the listener to fill the place of `seme` with the appropriate information.
These types of question are often answered with a full sentence.
You may also just say the phrase in question.

Examples:
`jan seme li toki` - "Who is speaking?"  
`mi toki.` - "I am."

`ona li seme` ("What did they do?")  
`ona li tawa tomo ona` ("They walked home.")

`sina lukin e seme` ("What are you watching?")  
`mi lukin e waso` ("I am watching birds.")


## "relative clauses"
In toki pona, building sentences that ar similar to relative clauses requires multiple sentences (often just two).
We can do so by using the word `ni` to mark the word we want to describe further,
and then postponing that further description until the end of the current sentence.

Examples:  
`jan ni li pona tawa mi: ona li mama e kasi` - "People who care for plants are good to me."  
`soweli li lukin e waso ni: ona li tawa lon ma kasi` - "The animal watches birds that fly through the forest."

Another strategy is to move the descriptive sentence to the beginning and append the main sentence.

Examples:  
`jan li mama e kasi. jan ni li pona tawa mi` - People who care for plants are good to me."  
`jan li mama e kasi. ona li pona tawa mi` - People who care for plants are good to me."  
`waso li tawa lon ma kasi. soweli li lukin e waso ni` - "The animal watches birds that fly through the forest."  
`waso li tawa lon ma kasi. soweli li lukin e ona` - "The animal watches birds that fly through the forest."


## ordinals
In toki pona, numbers higher than a few are intentionally *very* hard to express.
For ordinal numbers, just attach the pseudo-particle `nanpa` and then a number.
Using `nanpa` as an ordinal marker, it has a built-in `pi`, so you don't need to add that.

Examples:
`sina jan nanpa wan lon tomo ni` - "You are the first person in this building."
`ilo nanpa wan li pona. ilo nanpa tu li pona ala` - "The first tool is good. The second tool isn't."

## comparisons
For comparatives, there are multiple possible constructions.
It is easiest to learn by example:  
`jan Ipe li suli. jan Sunsi li lili` - "Sunsi is smaller than Ipe."  
`tomo mi la tomo sina li loje mute` - "Your house is more red than mine."

Superlatives can be expressed with the ordinal `nanpa wan` ("first"):  
`pona la toki ni li nanpa wan` - "When it comes to goodness, this language is the best."


# in-depth
This section provides more detailed info on how to use and not to use specific words and constructions.

## more info on particles

### the particle `en`
The particle `en` is a subject marker that is always omitted for the first subject.
Like all particles, it does not have any semantic meaning.
It is not a general conjunction (cf. [how to say "and"](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#how-to-say-and)),
but often mistaken for one by new learners.

Examples:  
`jan en soweli li sama mute` - "People and animals are very similar."  
`sina en mi li toki` - "You and I are talking."  
`tenpo mute la kon en telo li wawa` - "Wind and rain are often powerful."  
`jan An en jan Pita en ja Sen en jan Ton li lon` - "Ann, Peter, Sam, and Tom are here."

### the particle `li`
The particle `li` is a predicate marker.
Like all particles, it does not have any semantic meaning.
It is only omitted if the subject is *exactly* and *only* "mi", or *exactly* and *only* "sina".
Thus, we say `mi pali` since the subject is `mi`,
but neither in `pali mi li pona` (subject: `pali mi`) nor in `mi taso li lon tomo` (subject: `mi taso`) can `li` be omitted.

If we want to add more than one predicate to a sentence that start with `mi` or `sina`, we can still do that by using `li`.

Often, we can tell from a missing `li` that an utterance is not a complete sentence.
This is of course only true if the subject is not `mi` or `sina` and if `li` is not replaced by `o` (see below).

Examples:  
`soweli li suwi` - "The animal is cute."  
`mi kama li lukin li anpa` - "I cam, saw, and conquered."
`ona li pali mute li lape lili` - "They work a lot and sleep a bit."  

### the particle `e`
The particle `e` is the direct-object marker.
Like all particles, it does not have any semantic meaning.
The direct object in sentences is either the *patient* of an action or the *stimulus* of an experience.

The *patient* of an action is the thing that the subject changes by performing the action that is described by the predicate.  
Example: `soweli li pakala e kasi` - "The animal breaks off the plant."

The *stimulus* is something the subject percieves, feels, or thinks.  
Example: `mi lukin e mun` - "I watch the stars."

We do not use `e` to mark indirect (prepositional) objects.
They are neither patient nor stimulus.
They are instead marked by prepositions.
Example: `mi pali lon tomo` - "I work in the room."  
Note the difference: `mi pali e tomo` - "I build a room."

We also don't use `e` when the prepositional phrase follows `li` directly.
Example: `ona li tawa tomo` - "They go to the house."  
Note the difference: `ona li tawa e tomo` - "They [physically] move the house."

Examples:  
`waso li mama e waso lili` - "The bird cares for the chicks."
`jan Ali li sona e toki Alapi e toki Lasina e toki Inli e toki Putonwa` - "Ali knows Arabic, Latin, English, and Mandarin."

### the particle `la`
The particle `la` marks contextual phrases and sentences.
Like all particles, it does not have any semantic meaning.
We put the context first, then `la`, and then the sentence that should be interpreted in the given context:  
`X la Y li Z` - "In the context of X, Y is/does Z."

`la` can be used for adding many kinds of information, e.g. tense, manner, place, evidentiality, etc.
We can also use it for if-then statements, in case a complete sentence precedes the `la`.
What's more, we can put prepositional phrases in front of it
and it will mean the same as when appending the same phrase (albeit with different focus):

Examples:  
`tenpo lon la mi sitelen e lipu sona` - "Right now, I write a knowlegde-document."  
`mi la ni li pona` - "As for me, this is nice."  
`jan Pala la suno li wawa a` - "Barbara told me that the sun is intense!"
`supa tomo li jaki la jan li telo e ona` - "If the floor is dirty, then people wash it."  
`kepeken ilo telo wawa la mi weka e jaki tan supa` - "I powerclean the front-porch."

### the particle `pi`
The particle `pi` marks the head of a phrase that acts as a modifier for another head.
It is never used for single-word modifiers.
Like all particles, it does not have any semantic meaning.

By default, modifiers are applied from left to right to the head.
If a `pi` is added, everything that follows pi becomes its own phrase, that modifes the head preceding `pi` as one.  
Examples:  
`jan lawa mute` - "many head-people" (e.g. "many leaders")  
`jan pi lawa mute` - "many-headed person"  
`ilo tawa lili mute` - "many small movement-tools" (e.g. "many skaetboards")  
`ilo pi tawa lili mute` - "tool related to many small movements" (e.g. "electric toothbrush")  
`ilo tawa pi lili mute` - "very small movement-tool"

While it is technically possible to use multiple pi-phrases inside of each other,
the general principle of avoiding recursion suggests that it is better to just use sentences to describe the compound in more detail.
If for some reason we would be forced to use multiple `pi` inside one phrase,
we need to be aware that there is ambiguity in whether they all apply to the overall head or to the smallest phrase they follow.

### the particle `o`
The particle `o` is a second predicate marker, as well as a vocative marker.
Like all particles, it does not have any semantic meaning.
It is used in place of `li` when issuing commands, or describing wishes or desires.
In direct commands to the listener, the subject `sina` can be omitted.  
`[sina] o tawa pona` - "Drive carefully!"

For wishes and desires, replace `li` by `o`.  
`ona o lape` - "They should sleep."

Other than `li`, `o` cannot be omitted with `mi` or `sina`.  
`mi o toki pona` - "I should speak clearly."

For vocative, `o` can be appended to a phrase to address the thing described by said phrase.  
`jan Su o` - "Hey Su!"

Combining vocative and imperative can also be done easily:  
`jan Su o lape pona` - "Hey Su, sleep well!"

### the emoticle `a`
The word `a` can be appended to any word, phrase, or sentence to add emotional emphasis.
It can also be used on its own to express utterances like "ah!", "oh!", "wow!", etc.**

Examples:  
`pona a` - "So good!"  
`ike a` - "Oh dang!"  
`o lukin e pali mi a` - "Look at my work!" \[e.g. implying pride or sadness, depending on context]
`ni li musi a tawa mi` - "This is so fun!"

## a comparative analysis of prepositions
This section provides a comparative analysis of how prepositions work in toki pona.
Since it contains some unusual interpretations, alternative readings are given as well.

*idea*  
`X li Y e Z` ≈ `X li pali e ni: Z li Y`

*the prepositions*
- `tawa` - to, towards, from the perspective of
- `lon` - in, at, on
- `sama` - like, similar to
- `tan` - from, because of
- `kepeken` - using, by means of

*prepositional phrases*
- `mi pana e ijo tawa ona` - "I give them a thing."
- `mi awen lon tomo` - "I stay in the house."
- `mi pali sama ona` - "I work like them."
- `mi suli tan moku` - "I am big because of food."
- `mi toki kepeken kalama` - "I speak by means of sound."

## context
If you have ever asked a `jan pi toki pona` how to say some word from a natural language,
you will probably have heard about *context.*
It is the almighty disambiguator, the thing that condenses the vast semantic fields of our utterance into manageable dimensions.
It lets us understand whether someone is talking about a fox's burrow, a zoo, or a cat-shaped house.

The context of a sentence encompasses the entire experience the speaker and listener have while communicating.
In one situation `mi o tawa` means "I should leave.", in another it is "Let's go!".

Beginners often try to express the wildest things in single phrases.
They stack `pi` upon `pi`, throw in more and more modifiers,
and end up with an unwieldy construction that is hard to intepret (at best) and even harder to come up with on the fly.
When context is missing, all the building blocks of the phrase can be misinterpreted.
This is why we need to *establish* the appropriate context in toki pona, before we can go on to say the things we want to say.
Instead of throwing all the information about the intended word into one phrase,
we should describe it in multiple short and easily interpretable sentences.

Getting a feeling for context is something this document cannot teach.
We need to practice toki pona with other speakers, especially those that have a firm grasp on the language.
