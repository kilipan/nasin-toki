# nasin toki pona—a good way to speak
*by jan Juli (kili pan Juli / cile pa n-Ile)*

In this document I aim to provide a comprehensive grammar of toki pona.
Since toki pona is a very personal language, this document reflects my own **opinions** and **style decisions**.
That said, nothing about this *nasin toki* is unusual.
If you follow this grammar, you will be well understood by most (if not all) toki pona speakers.

💚 [toki pona](https://www.tokipona.org/) was created by Sonja Lang. My thanks and love, jan Sonja o!  
💚 I also want to thank the community, especially everyone who took the time to read this and give feedback!

## introduction
The document is roughly divided into three parts.

First, this short introductory chapter will cover some nomenclature and conventions that'll be used throughout the document.

Second, the [basics](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#basics) chapter will give an overview over grammatical constructions and
how they are arranged in a sentence, while giving a few example usages for easier digestion.

Third, the [in-depth](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#in-depth) chapter will cover all `pu` words one-by-one.
It will start with all the words that have special grammatical functions and then cover the pure content words,
going over examples, explorations of the semantic possibilities, and interactions with different grammatical structures.
(The content-word part will remain a work-in-progress for some time.)

## how to read this grammar
- Throughout this document, I will use
  - single capital letters (e.g. `X`) to represent any valid toki pona [*content word*](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#content-words) or [*phrase*](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#phrases)
  - `<prep>` to refer to any of the [*prepositions*](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#prepositions)
  - `<preverb>` to refer to any of the [*preverbs*](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#preverbs)
- Code-blocks contain valid toki pona (when replacing the above-mentioned abbreviations with real words).
Brackets mark the bracketed part as optional, e.g. `toki [ni] li pona`
- All translations are **only suggestions**.
Since toki pona is highly **context-sensitive**, there is never only a single valid interpretation of a given sentence.


## general principles
When using toki pona, it can help to keep in mind these general principles.

### implied politeness
There is no need for formalities like "please" and "thank you" in toki pona.
Generally, politeness is assumed per default.
That doesn't mean you can't tell someone what you are thankful for, though.
Instead of using empty formulaic ways to thank people, tell them why and how you are thankful, or that they are good!

### no sentence-level recursion
In many natural languages we can embed whole sentences into other sentences.
This is what I call sentence-level *recursion* here.
For example, we do this in English when building relative clauses.
In the sentence "I see people who walk to the house.", the relative clause is "who walk to the house",
which is basically a complete sentence on its own.
In toki pona, we cannot embed sentences in other sentences like that.
Instead, these things are split up into multiple sentences:  
`mi lukin e jan ni: ona li tawa tomo` - "I look at the person who is going to the house."

### no single word for "and"
To say "and", instead repeat the appropriate particle (cf. the [section on how to say "and"](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#how-to-say-and)).

### no tense-marking
In toki pona, we do not mark the predicate for tense.
All sentences that don't have explicit mentions of the time in other parts (like the indirect object or the context-phrase) can be interpreted as past, present, or future (or any other tense).


## word types
This section lists the types of words in toki pona.
Some people might analyze certain things differently.
Importantly, when these word types are mentioned in this document, the corresponding words listed here are what is referred to.

### particles
*Particles* are usually small words that only or primarily have grammatical functions.
For usage details, see the respective sections on the particles in the [in-depth part](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#in-depth).

#### pure particles
`en`, `li`, `e`, `la`, `pi`, `o`, `anu`

*Pure particles* are words that have no semantic meaning on their own.
They are purely grammatical words that exist to mark parts of speech, context, and modifier-order.

#### emoticle
`a`

The word `a` does not fit well into the other categories and thus gets its own place here as the *emoticle* (a portmanteu of emotion and particle).
It is used to add emotional emphasis to words, phrases, or whole sentences.

### pseudo-particles
`nanpa`, `kin`, `ala`, `taso`

The *pseudo-particles* are words that have particle-like properties, but can also be used like content words.
They are therefore listed as their own category.
As with the particles, check their respective sections in the [in-depth part](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#in-depth) for more details.

### content words
Literally every other word in toki pona is a *content word* with semantic meaning attached.
Every content word can work like all of what is called "adjective", "adverb", "verb", "noun" in English.
Some of these are part of special groupings that give them additional grammatical functions.
All the words that aren't mentioned explicitly here are pure content words.

#### pronouns
`mi`, `sina`, `ona`, `ni`

The *pronouns*, like all content words in toki pona, are *both* singular and plural (quite like the English "you").

#### prepositions
`lon`, `tawa`, `tan`, `sama`, `kepeken`

*Prepositions* are used to further describe the manner of the predicate.
They indicate information about where, whither, whence, how, or whereby the predicate is performed.
They can also occur without a preceding predicate and turn into a predicate themselves, describing the actions of the subject instead.

#### preverbs
`wile`, `sona`, `awen`, `kama`, `ken`, `lukin`  

The *preverbs* are special words that can change the meaning of the predicate in ways normal modifiers cannot.
Unlike all other modification in toki pona, they occur *before* the predicate they are applied to.

#### question word
`seme`

The *question word* `seme` behaves like a content word from a grammatical point of view.
Importantly, that means that unlike in various natural languages, it cannot be used as a relative pronoun.

### loan words
All capitalized words are names of things. Grammatically, they are similar to content words, but usually do not occur as a head. 



# basics

## sentence structure
A basic toki pona sentence looks like this:

`X li Y [e Z]`[^li-dropping]

(more complex sentence structures are of course possible, if really necessary (e.g. [here](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#combining-different-conjunctions)))

[^li-dropping]: Whenever our main character, the subject `X` is exactly the word `mi` (and nothing else) or exactly the word `sina` (and nothing else), the particle `li` is dropped from the sentence.
  Examples:
  *only* `mi`: `mi lukin e ona` - "I see them.";
  *not only* `mi`: `tomo mi li lili` - "My house is small."
  
Example:  
`soweli li moku e kili` - "An animal eats fruit."

#### the subject
- In the example above, `X` is the main character of our sentence, the **subject**
  - It can be a person, a thing, an idea, anything really
  - The important part is that our sentence describes what `X` is or is doing
#### the predicate
- In the example above, `Y` is this thing they are or are doing, the **predicate**
  - It can be an action; like working, playing, talking
  - ... a description; like blue, good, tall
  - ... or a thing; like house, animal, food
#### the direct object
- In the example above, `Z` is the thing that the action is done to, the **direct object**
  - It can also be basically any kind of thing or being
  - It is either the receiver of the action `Y` performed by `X`,
    e.g. `soweli li pali e tomo` - "The animal builds a nest."
  - ... or the stimulus that `X` experiences through doing `Y`,
    e.g. `soweli li lukin e kili` - "The animal sees a fruit."


## phrases
Since toki pona has a very minimalist lexicon, all the content words cover
broad semantic fields.
To specify what we are talking about, we can build multi-word *phrases*.  
In general, a phrase consists of a main content word, the **head**, and zero or
more additional content words, the **modifier(s)**.

The head is the main thing we are talking about, while the modifiers further
specify the head's (usually very broad) semantic field. We can always remove
any modifiers from a given phrase without changing that it *could* refer to the
same thing as before, but it becomes less specific by doing so. (Exception:
modification with `ala`, see below.)

Example:  
In `tomo waso` ("bird-house"), the word `tomo` is the head while `waso` modifies it.
We are talking first and foremost about a `tomo`.
The modifier tells us that the `tomo` is in some way related to the semantic field of `waso`.

We use *loan words* like any other modifier:  
`ma Kanata li suli` - "The land called Kanada is big."  
`lipu kulupu Wikipesija li sona e ijo mute` - "The community-document Wikipedia knows a lot of things."

### negation
To negate a phrase, just append the word `ala`.

Examples:  
`mi pali ala` - "I will not work."  
`jan ala li lon tomo ni` - "Nobody is in this house."  
`sina utala ala e waso suli` - "You didn't fight the horse-sized duck."  
`ilo li tawa e jan ala` - "The tool moves no persons." (Maybe it's a conveyor belt in a factory.)

### multiple modifiers
If multiple modifiers are present they all apply to the head of the phrase.
We can simply append additional modifiers.
Thus, `X Y Z` is an `X` that is related to `Y` and to `Z`.
Often, the order in which modifiers occur is not very important, apart from slightly changing the focus. An exception is modification with the word `ala`.

Examples:  
`soweli suli pimeja` - "dark big animal"  
`soweli pimeja suli` - "big dark animal"  
`jan lawa pona` - "good ruling person"  
`jan pona lawa` - "ruling good person"  
`tomo ala mute` - "many non-houses"  
`tomo mute ala` - "not many houses"

### the particle `pi`
To modify the head of one phrase with another phrase instead of a single content word, we precede that second phrase with `pi`.

Example:  
`poki pi telo wawa` - "strong-liquid container", e.g. a cup of coffee, but  
`poki telo wawa` - "strong liquid-container", e.g. a diamond bottle

### no objects in phrases
Generally, objects cannot be part of phrases.
They are a kind of recursion that is usually not done in toki pona.[^objects-in-phrases]
As such, we can use the prepositions as content words in phrases.

[^objects-in-phrases]: While this is universally true for direct objects (marked with `e`), some people do use indirect, prepositional objects in phrases.
  I personally avoid such constructions, since I dislike a few things about them.  
  (1) Their usage makes it hard to use prepositions in their content-word versions in phrases.  
  (2) They can often be expressed by removing the preposition (if a single word is following it)
  or replacing the preposition with `pi` (if multiple words are following).  
  (3) They, like all other kinds of objects, lead to recursions that I do not consider *pona.*


## how to use prepositions
[Prepositions](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#prepositions) are generally used to mark different kinds of indirect objects.
They can be used in two ways.
They are either appended to the predicate they modify (possibly including a
direct object as well) or come directly after `li` and become the predicate
themselves.  
- `X li Y [e Z] <prep> W`: the prepositional phrase describes the predicate `Y`  
- `X li <prep> Y`: the prepositional predicate describes the subject `X`'s action or state

Importantly, `e` is not used to mark the prepositional objects!

Example:  
`kasi li suli tan wawa suno` - "The plants are big because of the sun's power."  
`mi sama sina` - "I am like you."  
`ona li kepeken ilo` - "They use tools."  
Note that these last two constructions may seem strange at first. In the `sama` sentence the English copula "to be" has no equivalent.
This is because toki pona simply doesn't have a copular content word.  
In the `kepeken` sentence, the (seemingly direct) object is not marked with `e`. The resolution: `kepeken` is a word that does not exist in English.
Its *indirect* object is the thing that's being used (to achieve something), not its direct object, like would be the case for the English verb "to use".

### negation of prepositions
Usually, prepositions cannot be modified when used in their grammatical function. We can follow them with the particle `ala`, though.
This negates the preposition.

`mi lon ala tomo` - "I am not in the house."  
`soweli li tawa ala kasi` - "The naked mole rat does not move to the eggplant."


## how to use preverbs
The [preverbs](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#preverbs) are used to change the semantic field in ways that simple modifiers cannot.
They are added *before* the predicate they are applied to.

`X li <preverb> Y [e Z]`

Note that the direct object (here `Z`) relates to the predicate (here `Y`) and *not* to the preverb.
The individual preverbs are covered in more detail [here](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#more-info-on-preverbs).

### negation of preverbs
As with prepositions, preverbs cannot be modified when used in their grammatical function. But we can also follow them with the particle `ala`.
This negates the preverb.

`mi wile ala toki` - "I don't want to talk."  
`waso li kama ala suli` - "The bird didn't become important."


## how to say "and"
The word "and" has no translation in toki pona.
Instead, a general rule is to just repeat the appropriate particle to form conjunctions.

#### multiple subjects
To combine different phrases into a subject, we use the word `en`.

`X en Y li Z`  
`A en B en C li D`

#### multiple predicates
To say that a subject `X` is doing two things, `Y` and `Z` we just repeat the predicate marker `li` like so:

`X li Y li Z`

Note that `X` and `Y` here may also be prepositional predicates.

If the subject is `mi` or `sina`, we have no `li` to repeat, so in that case, we simply start a new sentence.[^extended-li-note]

[^extended-li-note]: In *lipu pu*, this is the only way to have multiple
  predicates with `mi` and `sina`, but some people also add new predicates with
  `li` If the subject is `mi` or `sina`, they just leave out the first `li` as
  usual, but still use it for any following predicates: `mi X li Y li Z`. This
  leads to new ambiguities and I personally recommend going with the
  *pu*-style.

`mi X. mi Y. mi Z`

#### multiple direct objects
To add multiple objects, just repeat the particle `e`.

`A li B e C e D`

#### multiple prepositional phrases
We can also add multiple prepositional phrases to a sentence.

`A li B <prep> C <prep> D`  

Here are some examples of how to say or not say "and" in prepositional contexts:  
`waso li musi kepeken wawa kepeken kon` - "Birds play using power and air."  
`jan Pin li sama jan Po li sama jan Kiko.` - "Finn is like Bob and like Rico." (Note the additional `li`.)  
`jan Pin li sama jan Po sama jan Kiko.` - "Finn, like Rico, is like Bob."    
Note the difference between these last two examples! In the second version without the additional `li`, the second `sama` is a prepositional phrase describing the (prepositional) predicate.

#### in `pi`-phrases
While the general principle suggests that all pi-phrases should simply apply to the overall head of the phrase,
context can often indicate that instead, the internal `pi` relates to the head of the external `pi`-phrase instead.

In general, we should avoid using multiple `pi` inside of one big phrase,
because shorter phrases are easier to parse and less grammatically ambiguous.

#### combining different conjunctions
When multiple predicates are present, it can be ambiguous which predicate(s) the object(s) and preposition(s) apply to.

Example:  
`jan li pali li pakala e tomo e ilo lon ma kepeken luka`  
Note how this ambiguity is also present in English:
"The person builds and breaks houses and tools in the field by means of their hands."

We can often resolve the ambiguity by restructuring, depending on what is really meant:  
`jan li pali e tomo lon ma li pakala e ilo kepeken luka` - "The person builds a house in the field and breaks tools using their hands."  
`jan li pali e tomo e ilo kepeken luka li pakala e ona lon ma` - "The person builds houses and tools using their hands and breaks them in the field."


## questions
There are three different ways to build a question. Note that since all of them
unambiguously mark the sentence as a question, we have no need for a question
mark in toki pona.

### `X ala X`
This construction is used for simple yes-or-no questions: `Y li X ala X`  
It asks the listener which one of the sentences `Y li X` and `Y li X ala` is true.  
To answer an `X ala X` question, we simply repeat the predicate (`X`) to say that `Y li X` is true, or the predicate followed by `ala` (`X ala`) to say that `Y li X ala` is true.[^lon-answer]
For the second case, we can also just say `ala`.
Of course it is always possible to answer in a full sentence instead.

[^lon-answer]: Some people also answer these kinds of questions with `lon`, meaning "true" or "correct". I advise against doing so, since in the `X ala X` construction it is not clear which of the choices is explicitly asked for.

Example:  
`soweli loje li moku ala moku e kili` - "Do foxes eat vegetables?"  
`moku ala` - "No."

Special cases:
- If there is a [preverb](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#preverbs) before the predicate, apply `X ala X` to the preverb instead of the main-predicate,  
  e.g. `kili li kama ala kama suli` ("Did the fruit grow big?").
- If the predicate is a [phrase](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#phrases), you may just repeat the head,  
  e.g. `jan li pana ala pana pi wawa mute e sike` ("Does the person yeet the ball?").
- To stress what you are asking for, you can also `X ala X` other parts of the sentence,  
  e.g. `soweli ala soweli li nasin e sina` ("Did an *animal* lead you?")

### `anu seme`
The second way to ask a yes-or-no question is `X li Y anu seme`.
This is not much different from the first, but it suggests that a less simple answer than just "yes" or "no" may be expected.
It is answered the same way as the `X ala X` question.

Example:  
`ma sina li lete anu seme` - "Is it cold where you are?"  
`lete. taso suno pini li seli a` - "Yes, but yesterday it was very warm!"

Note: `anu seme` can be interpreted as just a variant of a normal `seme` question (see below) in combination with the particle `anu`.

### `seme`
If we replace the thing that is asked for with `seme`, we can ask an open question.
Using this construction, we ask the listener to fill the place of `seme` with the appropriate information.
These types of question are often answered with a full sentence.
You may also just say the phrase in question.

Examples:
`jan seme li toki` - "Who is speaking?"  
`mi toki.` - "I am."

`ona li seme` ("What did they do?")  
`ona li tawa tomo ona` ("They walked home.")

`sina lukin e seme` ("What are you watching?")  
`mi lukin e waso` ("I am watching birds.")


## "relative clauses"
In toki pona, building sentences that are similar to relative clauses requires multiple sentences (often just two).
We can do so by using the word `ni` to mark the word we want to describe further,
and then postponing that further description until the end of the current sentence.
(Putting the description before the rest of the sentence is also fine.)

Examples:  
`jan ni li pona tawa mi: ona li mama e kasi` - "People who care for plants are good to me."  
`soweli li lukin e waso ni: ona li tawa lon ma kasi` - "The animal watches birds that fly through the forest."

Another strategy is to move the descriptive sentence to the beginning and append the main sentence.

Examples:  
`jan li mama e kasi. jan ni li pona tawa mi` - "People who care for plants are good to me."  
or `jan li mama e kasi. ona li pona tawa mi` - "People who care for plants are good to me."  
`waso li tawa lon ma kasi. soweli li lukin e waso ni` - "The animal watches birds that fly through the forest."  
or `waso li tawa lon ma kasi. soweli li lukin e ona` - "The animal watches birds that fly through the forest."


## ordinals
For ordinal numbers, just attach the pseudo-particle `nanpa` and then a number.
Using `nanpa` as an ordinal marker comes with a built-in `pi`, so you mustn't add that.

Examples:  
`sina jan nanpa wan lon tomo ni` - "You are the first person in this building."  
`ilo nanpa wan li pona. ilo nanpa tu tu li pona ala` - "The first tool is good. The fourth tool isn't."

## comparisons
For comparatives, there are multiple possible constructions.
It is easiest to learn by example:  
`jan Ipe li suli. jan Sunsi li lili` - "Sunsi is smaller than Ipe."  
`tomo mi la tomo sina li loje mute` - "Your house is more red than mine."

Superlatives can be expressed with the ordinal `nanpa wan` ("first"):  
`pona la toki ni li nanpa wan` - "When it comes to goodness, this language is the best."  
`toki ni li pona nanpa wan` - "This is the best language."


## transitives
Sometimes, we come across strange constructions in toki pona.
Things like `mi tomo e waso`[^ke-tami] may look confusing at first, but there are simple strategies to interpret this.

[^ke-tami]: Thank you for the great example, jan Ke Tami!

When we use the construction `X li Y e Z` we usually mean one of two things, depending on [context](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#context):

- The subject causes the object be Y, "X causes Z to be Y.".
  In terms of toki pona, we can restructure this to `X li pali e ni: Z li Y`.  
  `mi pona e tomo` - e.g. "We cause the room to be good.", or "I repair the house."  
  `mi tomo e waso` - e.g. "We turn the bird into a house." (Maybe it is a very big bird and we can live in its plumage!)
- The subject applies Y to the object, "X applies Y to Z.".  
  `mi luka e soweli len` - e.g. "I pet the hidden dog.", or "I hit the plush toy."  
  `mi tomo e waso` - e.g. "I apply the house to a bird, i.e. I put the bird into the house"  
  `sina telo e sina` - e.g. "You wash yourselves.", or "You spill water on yourself."


## interjections
A way to comment on things without building full sentences are *interjections*.
They usually consist of a simple phrase, a prepositional phrase, or both. We
have already seen an example of simple interjections in the section on
[questions](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#questions), specifically when
answering yes-no questions. Other uses include (but aren't limited to) short
comments on things we're currently experiencing or feeling, and expressions of
our opinions on things.

Examples:  
`pona a` - "so nice!"  
`waso suwi` - "sweet bat!"  
`wawa tawa sina` - "may the force be with you!"  
`tan seme a` - "why?!"  
`a` - "oh!", "ah!", "wow!", ...


## context
If you have ever asked a `jan pi toki pona` how to say some word from a natural language,
you will probably have heard about *context.*
It is the almighty disambiguator, the thing that condenses the vast semantic fields of our utterance into manageable dimensions.
It lets us understand whether someone is talking about a fox's burrow, a zoo, or a cat-shaped house.

The context of a sentence encompasses the entire experience the speaker and listener have while communicating.
In one situation `mi o tawa` means "I should leave.", in another it is "Let's go!".

Beginners often try to express the wildest things in single phrases.
They stack `pi` upon `pi`, throw in more and more modifiers,
and end up with an unwieldy construction that is hard to intepret (at best) and even harder to come up with on the fly.
When context is missing, all the building blocks of the phrase can be misinterpreted.
This is why we need to *establish* the appropriate context in toki pona, before we can go on to say the things we want to say.
Instead of throwing all the information about the intended word into one phrase,
we should describe it in multiple short and easily interpretable sentences.

Getting a feeling for context is something this document cannot teach.
We need to practice toki pona with other speakers, especially those that have a firm grasp on the language.



# in-depth
This section provides more detailed info on how to use and not to use specific words and constructions.

## more info on sentence structure
A more complete sentence structure of toki pona is given here. Note again that if
the subject is *only* `mi` or *only* `sina`, then you need to leave out the
first `li` of that sentence, which is not explicitly marked below.

`[(A|<prep> A|<sentence>) la]* B [en C]* {li [<preverb>]* D [e F]* [<prep> G]*}+`

- `<sentence>` stands for any well-formed sentence here  
- `(X|Y|Z)` stands for "pick either `X`, `Y`, or `Z`"
- The asterisk (`*`) means that an object of the same form as the preceding one
may occur any number of times (including zero)  
- The plus sign (`+`) means that an object of the same form as the preceding one
may occur any number of times (excluding zero)

Note that in general, sentences are **much (!)** more simple and don't use a
lot of this potential complexity. If we find ourselves writing long and complex
sentences, we should consider splitting the thought up a bit more.


## more info on particles

### the particle `en`
The particle `en` is a subject marker that is always omitted for the first subject.
Like all particles, it does not have any semantic meaning.
It is not a general conjunction (cf. [how to say "and"](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#how-to-say-and)),
but often mistaken for one by new learners.

Examples:  
`jan en soweli li sama mute` - "People and animals are very similar."  
`sina en mi li toki` - "You and I are talking."  
`tenpo mute la kon en telo li wawa` - "Wind and rain are often powerful."  
`jan An en jan Pita en jan Sen en jan Ton li lon` - "Ann, Peter, Sam, and Tom are here."

### the particle `li`
The particle `li` is a predicate marker.
Like all particles, it does not have any semantic meaning.  
It is only omitted if the subject is *exactly* and *only* `mi`, or *exactly*
and *only* `sina`.  Thus, we say `mi pali` since the subject is `mi`,
but neither in `pali mi li pona` (subject: `pali mi`) nor in `mi taso li lon
tomo` (subject: `mi taso`) nor in `sina en mi li toki` (subject: `sina en mi`)
can `li` be omitted.

If we want to add more than one predicate to a sentence that starts with `mi` or `sina`, we can instead just start a new sentence.

Often, we can tell from a missing `li` that an utterance is not a complete sentence.
This is of course only true if the subject is not `mi` or `sina` and if `li` is not replaced by `o` (see below).

Examples:  
`soweli li suwi` - "The animal is cute."  
`mi kama. mi oko. mi anpa` - "I came, saw, and conquered."  
`ona li pali mute li lape lili` - "They work a lot and sleep a bit."

### the particle `e`
The particle `e` is the direct-object marker.
Like all particles, it does not have any semantic meaning.
The direct object in sentences is either the *patient* of an action or the *stimulus* of an experience.

The *patient* of an action is the thing that the subject changes by performing the action that is described by the predicate.

Example: `soweli li pakala e kasi` - "The animal breaks off the plant."

The *stimulus* is something the subject percieves, feels, or thinks.

Example: `mi lukin e mun` - "I watch the stars."

We do not use `e` to mark indirect (prepositional) objects.
They are neither patient nor stimulus.
They are instead marked by prepositions.

Example: `mi pali lon tomo` - "I work in the room."  
Note the difference: `mi pali e tomo` - "I build a room."

As above `e` is not used to mark prepositional (indirect) objects, even in sentences where the predicate is left out.

Example: `ona li tawa tomo` - "They go to the house."  
Note the difference: `ona li tawa e tomo` - "They [physically] move the house."

Finally, `e` can *never* occur inside of phrases, e.g. in the subject or in a `pi`-phrase.

More examples:  
`waso li mama e waso lili` - "The bird cares for the chicks."  
`jan Ali li sona e toki Alapi e toki Lasina e toki Inli e toki Putonwa` - "Ali knows Arabic, Latin, English, and Mandarin."

### the particle `la`
The particle `la` marks contextual phrases and sentences.
Like all particles, it does not have any semantic meaning.
We put the context first, then `la`, and then the sentence that should be interpreted in the given context:  
`X la Y li Z` - "In the context of X, Y is/does Z."

`la` can be used for adding many kinds of information, e.g. tense, manner, place, evidentiality, etc.
We can also use it for if-then statements, in case a complete sentence precedes the `la`.
What's more, we can put prepositional phrases in front of it
and it will mean the same as when appending the same phrase (albeit with different focus):

Examples:  
`tenpo lon la mi sitelen e lipu sona` - "Right now, I write a knowlegde-document."  
`mi la ni li pona` - "As for me, this is nice."  
`jan Pala la suno li wawa a` - "Barbara told me that the sun is intense!"  
`supa tomo li jaki la jan li telo e ona` - "If the floor is dirty, then people wash it."  
`kepeken ilo telo wawa la mi weka e jaki tan supa` - "I powerclean the front-porch."

### the particle `pi`
The particle `pi` marks the head of a phrase that acts as a modifier for another head.
It is never used for single-word modifiers.
Like all particles, it does not have any semantic meaning.

By default, modifiers are applied from left to right to the head.
If a `pi` is added, everything that follows this `pi` becomes its own phrase,
that in turn modifes the head preceding the `pi` as one.

Examples:  
`jan lawa mute` - "many head-people" (e.g. "many leaders")  
`jan pi lawa mute` - "many-headed person"  
`ilo tawa lili mute` - "many small movement-tools" (e.g. "many skateboards")  
`ilo pi tawa lili mute` - "tool related to many small movements" (e.g. "electric toothbrush")  
`ilo tawa pi lili mute` - "very small movement-tool"

While it is technically possible to use multiple pi-phrases inside of each other,
the general principle of avoiding recursion suggests that it is better to just use sentences to describe the compound in more detail.
If for some reason we would be forced to use multiple `pi` inside one phrase,
we need to be aware that there is ambiguity in whether they all apply to the overall head or to the smallest phrase they follow.

### the particle `o`
The particle `o` is a second predicate marker, as well as a vocative marker.
Like all particles, it does not have any semantic meaning.
It is used in place of `li` when issuing commands, or describing wishes or desires.

In direct commands to the listener, the subject `sina` can be omitted.  
`[sina] o tawa pona` - "Drive carefully!"

For wishes, desires, and hopes, replace `li` by `o`. (This is also called *optative* mood.)  
`ona o lape` - "They should sleep."

Other than `li`, `o` cannot be omitted with `mi` or `sina`.  
`mi o toki pona` - "I should speak clearly."

For vocative, `o` can be appended to a phrase to address the thing described by said phrase.  
`jan Su o` - "Hey Su!"

Combining vocative and imperative can also be done easily:  
`jan Su o lape pona` - "Hey Su, sleep well!"

Note that the optative/imperative and vocative are not distinguishable when there's only one subject.

### the particle `anu`
Info on the word `anu` has always been notoriously hard to find,
while at the same time the community's usage of it is much more varied than with other words.

In general, `anu` is a conjunction meaning "or" (both exclusive and inclusive).
We can use it to join different parts of speech into a contextually appropriate *`anu`-phrase.*
What I am calling `anu`-phrase here consists of two valid phrases joined by the word `anu`.
These phrases then act as a new phrase that can occur in either of the subject, the predicate and the (direct and indirect) object.
Using `anu` inside of `pi`-phrases should be avoided due to the arising ambiguities.

Examples:  
`waso anu kala li tawa` - "The bird or the fish moves."  
`waso li pali anu pakala e tomo` - "Birds build or destroy the nest."  
`soweli li pali e tomo anu lupa` - "Animals build nests or burrows."


### the emoticle `a`
The word `a` can be appended to any word, phrase, or sentence to add emotional emphasis.
It can also be used on its own to express utterances like "ah!", "oh!", "wow!", etc.

Examples:  
`pona a` - "So good!"  
`ike a` - "Oh dang!"  
`o lukin e pali mi a` - "Look at my work!" \[e.g. implying pride or sadness, depending on context]  
`ni li musi a tawa mi` - "This is so fun!"


## more info on `ni`
`ni` can mean any of the following in the right context:
- "this/that/these/those"  
- as a modifier, in addition to the above: "related to this/that/these/those", "in this/that/these/those way(s)"  
- as a predicate: "to do this/that/these/those", "to be this/that/these/those"

Examples:  
`ni li pona` - "That is peaceful."  
`ona li oko e ni` - "They look at this."  
`tomo li suwi. jan li ni kin` - "The house is cute. The person also is."  
`soweli li len e kili lon ma. ona li ni tan tenpo lete` - "The squirrel hides some nuts in the ground. It does this because of winter."


## more info on pseudo-particles

### the pseudo-particle `nanpa`
As described in the section on [ordinals](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#ordinals),
the pseudo-particle `nanpa` is used for enumerating the head when appended directly to a phrase.

When there is also a `pi` present, we have to take care how we order things:  
`ilo pi akesi suwi nanpa wan` - "the first axolotl's tool"  
`ilo nanpa wan pi akesi suwi` - "the axolotol's first tool"

When `nanpa` occurs as a head, it describes the respective number instead of ordinals:  
`nanpa tu li nanpa pona tawa mi` - "I like the number two."  
`len pi nanpa wan li loje` - "The shirt with the number 1 printed on it is red."

We can slightly extend the usage of `nanpa` when pointing to the following, or last thing in an ordered list:  
`sitelen tawa nanpa pini li musi a` - "The last video was so fun!"  
`mi toki lon kalama pana nanpa kama` - "I will speak in the next podcast episode."

### the pseudo-particle `kin`
`kin` is an additive marker, which describes that a phrase *is* or *is doing* something *as well*,
or has something being done to it as well.
It is used similarly to the English word "too".

It can be appended like a modifier to any phrase, but cannot occur as a head itself.
The only exception is in the context-phrase `kin la`,
where it marks the whole following sentence as an addition to what was already said.
It is often preferable to specify more in which way the sentence is *as well*, e.g. with `sama la`
("equivalently", "similarly", ...) or `ante la` ("also, unrelatedly", "on the other hand", ...).

Examples:  
`jan li ken pona kin` - "People can also be peaceful."  
`kin la ma li sike e suno` - "Furthermore, the earth revolves around the sun."

Examples of different placement:  
`ona kin li pali e lipu` - "*They write* a book, too [among other writers of books]."  
`ona li pali kin e lipu` - "They *write* a book, too [among other things being done to the book]."  
`ona li pali e lipu kin` - "They write a *book*, too [among other things being created]."  
Note that these sentences can all be translated the same in English,
potentially with differences in stress. While they have slightly different
focus, interpreting this too strictly is not advisable.

### the pseudo-particle `ala`
As we've seen in the section on [negation](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#negation),
the pseudo-particle `ala` can be used exactly like a content word when negating inside of phrases.

Aside from that, it can be a head itself, with semantic connotations of "nothingness", "void", etc.

Additionally, we can negate preverbs and prepositions with it, in a way that no other modifier can:  
`mi sona ala pali e tomo` - "I didn't know how to build the house."  
`kala li moku kepeken ala ilo` - "The fish ate without using tools."

### the pseudo-particle `taso`
The word `taso` is similar to `kin` in *where* it can occur.
Its meaning is different, of course.
Using it as a modifier, we can indicate that the marked phrase is the "only" thing that the sentences statement applies to.
Sentence initially, it marks the whole sentence as contrary to some previous statement, like English "but".
In some contexts, it can even work as a head-noun.

Examples:  
`soweli li ken pona taso` - "Animals can only be good."  
`taso ma li sike e suno` - "But, the earth revolves around the sun."

Examples of different placement:  
`ona taso li pali e lipu` - "Only they write a book."  
`ona li pali taso e lipu` - "They only write a book."  
`ona li pali e lipu taso` - "They write only a book."

Examples of head-noun taso:  
`ona li taso` - "They are alone."  
`mi pilin ike ala tan taso mi` - "I don't feel bad because of being alone."


## a comparative analysis of prepositions
This section provides a comparative analysis of how prepositions work in toki
pona. Be aware that the fifth block contains some unusual constructions that not everyone would understand.

*idea*  
`X li Y e Z` ≈ `X li pali e ni: Z li Y`

*the prepositions*
- `tawa` - to, towards, from the perspective of
- `lon` - in, at, on
- `sama` - like, similar to
- `tan` - from, because of
- `kepeken` - using, by means of

*prepositional phrases*
- `mi pana e ijo tawa ona` - "I give them a thing."
- `mi awen lon tomo` - "I stay in the house."
- `mi pali sama ona` - "I work like them."
- `mi suli tan moku` - "I am big because of food."
- `mi toki kepeken kalama` - "I speak by means of sound."

*prepositional phrases without predicates*
- `mi tawa tomo` - "I go to the house."
- `mi lon telo` - "I am in the water."
- `mi sama ona` - "I am like them."
- `mi tan ma Apese` - "I am from Abc-land."
- `mi kepeken ilo` - "I do something by means of tools."

*transitive phrases with content-word versions of the prepositions*
- `mi tawa e soweli` - "I move the animal \[towards an unspecified location]."
- `mi lon e kala` - "I exist the fish (i make the fish exist) \[in an unspecified location/time/way]."
- `mi sama e akesi` - "I sameify the frog (i make the frog similar) \[to sth unspecified]."
- `mi tan e ona` - "I make them be the result \[of something unspecified]."
- `mi kepeken e ona` - "I make them use \[something unspecified]."

*transitive phrases with prepositional predicates* (unusual!)
- `mi tawa supa e soweli` - "I move the animal towards the table **or** "I surface-move the animal."
- `mi lon telo e kala` - "I exist the fish (i make the fish exist) in the water."
- `mi sama jan e akesi` - "I sameify the frog (i make the frog similar) to a person."
- `mi tan utala e ona` - "I make them be the result of conflict."
- `mi kepeken ilo e ona` - "I make them use a tool."


## more info on preverbs

### *pu* preverbs

#### wile
The word `wile` can be used for expressing things on our complete *hierarchy of
needs.*[^Seli]

[^Seli]: Thank you jan Seli for the fantastic hierarchy-of-needs explanation!

We can think of everything we might need or want as falling somewhere on this
hierarchy. In English, we call things that are very low in the hierarchy
(like e.g eating and sleeping) "needs". Similarly, we call things that are
rather high in the hierarchy (like e.g. watching another episode of that tv
series) "wants". The word `wile` covers *the complete hierarchy.*

As a preverb, `wile` marks the following predicate as falling in the hierarchy
of needs of the subject.

Examples:  
`ona li wile pana e kili` - "They want to donate the turnip."  
`jan lili li wile suli` - "The child wants to be an adult."  
`mi wile tawa lon nasin noka` - "I need to walk on the footpath."  
`soweli suli li wile lape lon tenpo lete` - "Bears need to sleep during the cold season."

#### sona
The preverb `sona` expresses that the subject knows how to be or do the
predicate.

Examples:  
`mi sona toki pona` - "I know how to speak simply."  
`waso li sona pali e tomo` - "Birds know how to build nests."  
`jan Oto li sona musi.` - "Otto knows how to be funny."

#### awen
Preverb `awen` expresses a continous status, or a continuously/repeatedly
happening predicate.

Examples:  
`o awen pali e ijo` - "Keep working on the thing!"  
`mi awen wile e ni` - "I still want this."  
`ona li awen weka` - "They remain far away."

#### kama
The preverb `kama` indicates that the predicate became / is becoming / will
become true. This means that the subject started doing or being something that
it was previously not or not doing.

Examples:  
`mi kama sona e toki pona` - "I learnt toki pona." (I didn't know it, and then I came to know it.)  
`akesi li kama lon nasin telo` - "The crocodile arrived in the river."  
`tomo li kama suli` - "The house became big." (E.g. when seeing a newly finished house that we only saw when it was much smaller.)

#### ken
The word `ken` expresses the ability to do something. We use it as a preverb to
show that the subject is able to be or do the predicate, or that it is possible
that the subject is or does the predicate.

Exampels:  
`sina ken toki tawa mi` - "You can speak to me."  
`jan li ken lape lon ma kasi ni` - "People are allowed to sleep in this forest."  
`kala li ken soweli` - "Marine animals can be mammalian."

#### lukin
The preverb `lukin` corresponds to trying, seeking, or looking to be or do
something. Since `oko` and `lukin` are introduced as synonyms in *lipu pu*, we
can arguably also use `oko` as a preverb. This is rarely done, though.

Examples:  
`mi lukin pini e lipu ni` - "I am trying to finish this document."  
`ona li lukin tawa waso` - "They are trying to fly."  
`mi oko jo e tomo lili lon ma kasi` - "I am trying to have a small cabin in the woods."


## other "preverbs"
These words are sometimes used as preverbs although they were not defined as
such in *lipu pu.* Many speakers don't use them and I personally also recommend against it.
There are very easy work-arounds for contextually saying the same thing, compare the alternative (non-exhaustive!) versions marked "some pu options".
Every additional preverb makes the grammar more ambiguous, compare the default non-preverb readings given for comparison (after "OR").

#### open
Used for starting being or doing something, `open` preverb introduces new
ambiguities into the grammar.

Examples:  
`ona li open pakala e lupa tomo` - "They start breaking the door." OR "They accidentally open the door."  
some pu options: `ona li open e pakala pi lupa tomo` or `ona li lukin pakala e lupa tomo`  
`jan li open pona e ma` - "People will start being good to nature." OR "People open-up well the land." (e.g. to dig a hole)  
some pu options: `pona ma la jan li open` or `jan li kama pona e ma`
 
#### pini
Analogously, the word `pini`, when used to indicate that we have finished being
or doing something, introduces similar ambiguities.

Examples:  
`mi pini tawa tomo sona` - "I have finished going to school." OR "I am done from the perspective of the school."  
some pu options: `mi awen ala tawa tomo sona` or `mi kama lon tomo sona`  
`soweli li pini jaki e tomo` - "The dog had finished besmirching the house." OR "The dog had disgustingly ended the house."  
some pu options: `tomo li kama jaki tan soweli` or simply `soweli li jaki e tomo`


#### alasa
Very similar to `lukin`, preverb `alasa` can be used to indicate trying to be
or do something. Compared to `lukin` it is sometimes said to have a more
focused and targeted vibe. Introducing this kind of distinction into the
simplistic toki pona seems questionable.  
For the recommended pu option, simply replace `alasa` with `lukin` here.

Examples:  
`mi alasa sitelen e lipu pona` - "I am pursuing writing a good document." OR "I document-scavenge the good books."  
`jan sona li alasa sona e ijo mute` - "The sage tries to know many things." OR "The sage wisely hunts many things."

## more info on content words

### on the definitions of toki pona words

To learn Toki Pona, understanding the meanings of its words is essential. Dictionaries are common resources for this, but many are flawed. They typically provide a list of five to eight English words as definitions, which is insufficient given Toki Pona's broad and complex semantic spaces. Ideally, definitions in Toki Pona should include a paragraph describing the semantic space of each word. This approach helps clarify the nuanced meanings and uses of words. Therefore, discussions about the semantic spaces of Toki Pona words are important. A comprehensive dictionary that explains these semantic spaces would be valuable, even though it requires significant effort. By nature, Toki Pona's word meanings are best understood through conversation.

In Toki Pona, any word can refer to anything, but this power shapes perceptions. The semantic spaces described here should be seen as traits rather than objects. The more a description fits an object, the better the word applies. However, metaphor is a natural part of Toki Pona due to its vast semantic spaces. A semantic space encompasses all possible meanings of a word. This dictionary aims to describe these spaces and identify common traits among concepts within them.

### the dictionary

*based on the [lipamanka dictionary](https://lipamanka.gay/essays/dictionary)*

#### akesi

`akesi` are creatures. They tend to be cold to the touch. When they move quickly, they go back and forth on sprawling legs or slither or squirm across the ground if they lack legs. They're close to the ground. They usually lay eggs.

#### ala

The semantic space of `ala` contains nothing. However, it isn't void of information. "ala li lukin e kili" can mean "nobody's looking at the fruit." "jan li moku e ala" can mean "the person ate nothing." As a modifier, it actually reverses the semantic space of whatever words come before it, which no other content word does. "soweli li alasa ala e kili" can mean "the monkey doesn't forage for fruit." An "ijo ala" is never a type of `ijo`. As a verb, `ala` can mean "erase" or "delete."

#### alasa

`alasa` refers to hunting and foraging. Searching for a lost object is `alasa`. Searching for something on a web browser is `alasa`. Throwing a spear into the side of a bison could be `alasa` because it is part of hunting, as can the act of picking berries. The core of `alasa` is trying to find. Recently (during the past half-decade), usage of `alasa` to refer to attempting or trying has become very common. So trying to knit could be a type of `alasa`. Trying to sprint could be a type of `alasa`. Trying to look larger than you actually are to scare off a predator could be `alasa`.

#### ale

`ale` is everything. This can be either everything ever or a smaller subset of everything. If you modify `ale` with another word, it is limited to objects that have that word's quality, such as "ale loje" for "all things red," "ale lipu" for "all things related to books," or "ale pali" for "all things related to working." This is often similar to the reverse, but not exactly the same. For example, "loje ale" is all reds, not all things red, "lipu ale" is all books, and would not talk about a printing press or reading glasses, and "pali ale" would be something like all jobs or activities, and wouldn't talk about a hammer or a cheesecloth.

#### anpa

`anpa` refers to the space (or sometimes object) below something. For example, "anpa supa" is the space under a table. "anpa kasi" is the space under a plant. `anpa` can also refer to qualities of defeat and shame, such as beating someone in a game of chess. You can describe the loser as `anpa`, and you can use `anpa` as a verb to mean "beat." `anpa` can also talk about social stratification and hierarchy. A lower-class person can be a "jan anpa".

#### ante

`ante` describes a different thing. There are many things in the world, and every thing has similarities and differences to other things. In a specific context, if one wishes to frame the differences between objects, `ante` is incredibly useful. It can refer to the different object itself, qualities of difference, or the concept of change itself. It can also be used as a verb to mean "alter" or "change."

#### awen

`awen` resists change. `awen` is the essence of inertia boiled down into one word. If an object is doing something and continues doing that thing, that continuation is `awen`. If an object is doing nothing, and continues doing nothing, that continuation is also `awen`. `awen` is a preverb and changes the meaning from "does the thing" to "continues to do the thing," or "still does the thing."

`awen` is also used by many speakers to mean "maintain." This is very close to the idea of protection, so you'll see `awen` used for that as well in many situations as a transitive verb.

#### esun

`esun` is a type of swap or exchange. Usually, it's used to mean "buy," "sell," or "trade." The use of a currency isn't required for something to be `esun`. Trading baseball cards is `esun`. `esun` doesn't imply that both parties lose something. Exchanging knowledge is `esun`, even though neither party loses knowledge. Some interesting extensions of `esun` include using `esun` for breathing, where one trades the air inside them with the outside world. Seeing `esun` as a swap more than as a type of buying has made it used far more often these days.

#### ijo

Everything is within the semantic space of `ijo`. If a thing is a thing, it is an `ijo`. This could be anything or something. This could be a physical object, an idea, an action, a place, a sentient being, or any other thing. You are in the semantic space of `ijo`.

Some people refuse to use `ijo` for sentient things. They claim it has inanimate connotations. Such speakers assumed it was the same as the English "thing" or Portuguese "coisa," etc. In reality, in toki pona, humans are as `ijo` as a dog, a book, or a galaxy.

#### ike

`ike` is any negative quality. Anything can be `ike`. `ike` is a judgment call. What one person considers `ike` can be `pona` to another. For example, the complexity of computer coding is not a good thing for me, so I'd call it `ike`. The simple melody of "Mary Had a Little Lamb" is boring to many people on its own, so they might call it `ike`. But a baby might enjoy it a lot, so despite being overly simple for adults in an anglophone culture, it's just right for that baby, i.e. `pona`. If something isn't bad, you can't use `ike` to describe it without framing it as such. `ike` can mean complex and simple just as easily as `pona` can.

#### ilo

The semantic space of `ilo` contains things that are used towards a goal. It’s easy to say that everything can be used. Likewise, if something is being used or can commonly be used, it is easy to call it an `ilo`. If I am using a hammer to hammer a nail into the wall, that is an `ilo`. If I am using a psychological method to calm myself down when I’m stressed, that can be an `ilo` as well. Without much context, `ilo` can refer to things that are commonly used as tools. With the context of it being used for something, though, anything can be an `ilo`.

#### insa

`insa` talks about things inside of things. Commonly, this is used to describe a location. The location inside of a car is `insa`. It can also be used to describe objects that are inside of things. Someone's organs are `insa`. `insa` doesn't need to be contained completely; it can just mean "in between." A book in the middle of a bookshelf is `insa`. The space between two city buildings is `insa`. It can be used more abstractly too. When compared to a head, a mind is `insa`. In the context of good and bad, `insa` can be neutral. When compared to hot and cold, `insa` can be lukewarm. If anything is being framed as inside of something else, it falls under the semantic space of `insa`.

#### jaki

`jaki` talks about unpleasant sensory experiences. This can be any of the senses, internal or external. This could be bad smells, repulsive flavors, gross images, ear-shattering noises, and horrible textures. But it could also be internal sensory experiences such as nausea. `jaki` can be used to refer to other things that aren't usually sensory, and it should be. But be careful, because using `jaki` will frame something through a sensory lens. If someone is acting bad, such as bullying or harassing someone else, you can describe their actions as `jaki`, but doing so frames their actions as unpleasant in a sensory way.

#### jan

Usage of `jan` differs a lot between groups of speakers, but many speakers use it broadly to refer to any sentient creature. However, this can break down when you consider what sentience is and where we draw lines between ourselves and nature.

#### jelo

`jelo` comes from the English word "yellow" and has a very similar meaning. It refers to yellows, oranges, and sometimes yellowish greens. I would use `jelo` to talk about any shade of cadmium yellow.

#### jo

`jo` is the act of holding, carrying, possessing, owning, or broadly having. The English word "have" tends to be pretty broad, and `jo` is no different, but the size of its semantic space differs between speakers. Some speakers will only use `jo` if an object is in someone's hand or they're holding it. Others will use `jo` for something as abstract as a word having sounds in it or a language having words in it. For some speakers, if I'm borrowing your book, you don't `jo` it anymore, I do, even if you own it. For other speakers, in that situation both you and I `jo` the book at the same time in different ways. When you use `jo`, you're drawing a metaphor between someone's relationship with an object and a world in which they're holding it in their hands. Some people like to stretch this metaphor much farther than others.

#### kala

Any creature that swims habitually is a `kala`. This can include anything from fish to whales to seals. The most important aspect of a `kala` is its relation to water. `kala` tend to either live in the water or spend a good portion of their time in it. Some speakers extend this usage a bit and let it refer to anything that is in water, like a human swimmer or a pool noodle. Sometimes, toki ponists will describe the act of showering as `kala`. This usage is often interpreted as somewhat funny, but it is commonly understood. If it isn't, it's easy to clarify.

#### kalama

The semantic space of `kalama` contains all noises and sounds and any act of creating a noise or sound. Any sound from any source can be a `kalama`. Music is a `kalama`. A scream is `kalama`. The sound that a tree makes when it falls in the forest is a `kalama`. A sound doesn't have to travel through the air to be a `kalama`: whale noises are `kalama`, and a heartbeat through a stethoscope is `kalama`. `kalama` could be an absolute pitch, or multiple. It could be sound designed to sound a certain way, or chaotic noise.

Seeing as sound is vibration and one often causes the other, many (deaf/hard of hearing) can perceive via vibrations what hearing people would perceive as sound. E.g. stamping on the floor, thumpy thumpy dance music or hammering from the downstairs flat renovating their bathroom waking you up at 8 am. Thus vibrations could be considered a form of `kalama`, especially to deaf/hard of hearing people.

Instead or in addition to `kute`, this form of `kalama` would pair with the verb `pilin`. E.g. 'mi pilin lon noka mi e kalama ilo tan supa anpa.'"

#### kama

`kama` is a strong metaphor in toki pona. To arrive at a location and to arrive at a state of being are the same concept in toki pona. This means that `kama` can refer to arriving home to eat dinner, arriving at school, or the moment you become an `akesi` because an evil prescriptivist wizard cursed you for using too many `nimisin`. This, of course, describes `kama`'s use as a preverb, in which its meaning is close to "become." This can imply the start, body, or end of this process. It's easy to describe the reverse of whatever process `kama` preverb is representing by negating the word that follows it, i.e. "kama X ala."

#### kasi

`kasi` is any number of types of plants. Big plants like trees are `kasi`, and small plants like weeds are too. Anything largely in the category of "plant" is a `kasi`. There's some controversy about fungi, though. Many believe them to be within `kasi`'s semantic space, while others disagree entirely and use a new word, "`soko`" (which is relatively commonplace). If you want to learn about someone's view on this, just pull up a picture of a mushroom and ask "ni li seme?" and wait for their response. Whether you use `kasi` to describe mushrooms or not says a lot about how you categorize life. For example, growing up I was told that mushrooms were not plants, so I developed schemes to interpret them differently. Using `kasi` for a mushroom doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. But that might be completely different for someone else. I often go for "`kili`" rather than the word "`soko`" when describing mushrooms.

#### ken

`ken` is all about abilities. These could be inherent abilities, like the ability to fly, walk, or swim. These could also be external, like permission to use the bathroom. If I can blow bubbles with bubble gum because I'm not around anyone who I don't want to annoy, that ability is a `ken`. Unlike some languages, toki pona has a single word that contains all abilities. `ken` can also refer to a probability or a possibility. The throughline here is almost saying that an event is able to occur, but that doesn't mean it necessarily will or won't. These ideas of possibility and ability are two sides of the same coin.

#### kepeken

`kepeken` is using. It is usually used as a preposition and not as a transitive verb, and marks the word after it as the object of usage. For example, "mi kepeken ilo" can be "I use a tool," and "mi pali e tomo kepeken ilo" can mean "I build a house using a tool." When used as a noun, it can refer to a specific instance of using something or usage in general. For example, "kepeken ni ilo sina li ike" "the way you're using the tool is bad." Many speakers consider `nasin` a better choice for this.

#### kili

`kili` are fruits and vegetables, i.e. any part of a plant that is edible. These could be fresh. An apple is `kili`. These could be fermented. Kimchi and pickled onions are `kili`. These could be preserved through canning. Strawberry jam and dried mango are `kili`. This could even be a sauce with a primary vegetable component: basil pesto is `kili`, gazpacho is `kili`, five minced onions are `kili`. `kili` can refer to wheat seeds or other grains that haven't been ground up yet, but flour and bread don't fit well into `kili`'s semantic space.

What if a `kili` is poisonous? Poisonous berries are not edible, but they can still be `kili`. This is because `kili`'s semantic space pivots towards things that resemble edible parts of plants, even if you can't actually eat them. By using `kili`, you evoke the image of eating it. This won't encourage toki pona speakers to eat it right away if they don't recognize it. If I used `kili` for poison ivy, a toki pona speaker would think less of it as a shrub that grows on the ground and more as a type of lettuce for making a salad. Of course, they wouldn't assume that it would be a good idea to do so, but the way the poison ivy feels in a conceptual semantic space is different.

A minority usage of `kili` as a child or product. This borrows a cognitive metaphor from a lot of European languages that see familial relations as trees. While this could work, it is likely to be misunderstood by many speakers unless you build up this before using `kili` like this.

#### kiwen

`kiwen` are things whose form resists changing. This often talks about a hard physical material or object, like a rock or wood or crystal. It can describe something's material, so a chair made out of a hard material could be `kiwen`. It is also possible to talk about nonphysical things using `kiwen`, but by using `kiwen` to describe nonphysical things, their forms are being framed as resisting change. For example, I can describe a recipe as `kiwen`. With some explaining, this might mean that in order for me to consider it my recipe, it must not change, and if it does change, it would no longer be my recipe. There are some other abstract perspectives of `kiwen` that differ from this, but they're often too abstract and not easily understood. I recommend clarifying what you mean with other words too if you use `kiwen` abstractly.

#### ko

`ko` is a fantastic word. It has an enormous semantic space and offers some interesting perspectives about moisture. `ko` refers to semisolids. What's a semisolid? Often toki ponists forget that most English speakers don't use this descriptor. A semisolid is something that has solid elements to it but isn't hard and doesn't resist a change in shape. Some examples are toothpaste, salt, sponges, jello, paint, clay, soil, flour, and sand. The throughline here is that `ko` ignores moisture completely. If you take any of these examples that are dry and add water, they become wet. Some dissolve into the water and supersaturate it, becoming something very similar and yet very distinct from a liquid. Some, such as flour and soil, become moldable and retain their shape (for example, dough or some sort of clay). A sponge becomes easier to reform and manipulate when it gets wet. A good thought experiment to get to know `ko` better is to choose any `ko` and think about what happens to it when the amount of water changes.

Something to consider for yourself: is a pillow `ko`? It feels similar to some types of clay or soil. You can kind of mold it.

#### kon

`kon` covers a very wide range of ideas that are loosely related to each other through the concept of being known but not seen. You'll often hear people use the phrase "unseen agent" to describe `kon`. I've divided this semantic space into three parts: spirits, meaning, and gas. toki pona connects these concepts by giving them all the same word.

A spirit could be some sort of supernatural being that we don't normally see. There are countless traditions around the globe that interpret divinity through unseen agents. For example, in Christianity, the concept of the Holy Ghost could very easily be a type of `kon`. Dybbukim in Jewish folklore can easily be `kon` because they're not things people commonly see. If a spirit shows itself and becomes seen, using `kon` still works great to communicate that it frequently is an unseen agent. The idea of a spirit can be extended to the part of humans or beings, depending on how a speaker considers the idea of a soul. Some people think that everything has a soul, while others think that only humans have souls. `kon` works very well for all of these souls, framing them as the unseen part of things. In fact, a minority of speakers goes as far as to call aspects of identity like gender types of `kon`. The broad idea behind this category is that `kon` can be used for, specifically, an unseen entity.

"Meaning" is a broad category. The most common usage of `kon` for meaning is semantic meaning, i.e. the meaning of words in language. Every semantic space entry in this dictionary could be described as an instance of "`kon`." If a speaker didn't know what another speaker meant even though they heard all the words, they could say that they didn't understand the "kon." Less often, you'll see `kon` used for more abstract ideas of meaning, such as the meaning of a piece of art. This category is about unseen ideas or parts of thought.

Finally, gas. Air is a very prototypical example of `kon`, but air is composed of a very specific set of gaseous matter. Even if a gas is visible, like steam or smoke, it's still squarely part of `kon`'s semantic space. The entirety of Jupiter can be `kon`. Clouds can be `kon`. Hell, the sun can even be `kon` if you're looking at what composes it and framing it from that perspective instead of framing it as a producer of light.

#### kule

`kule` are aspects of senses. The most prototypical version of this is color, an aspect of sight, but `kule` can also refer to aspects of other senses. Here are some possibilities: for sound, `kule` can refer to timbre or pitch. For taste, `kule` could be a flavor. For touch, `kule` could be a type of texture. There are plenty of ways to be creative with `kule`, but the most common uses besides "color" are the ones I've listed associated with sound.

#### kulupu

Any group of other things can be a `kulupu`. It's commonly used to describe groups of people: communities, clubs, cultures, cliques, charters, committees, collectives, corporations, and other words like a baseball team or a pride of lions. `kulupu` can also be groups of objects or animals, like a bunch of bananas, a basket filled with small clay pots, or a murder of crows. `kulupu` is often used to describe a plural system/collective (i.e. multiple people in one body). Usually, a `kulupu` will be a group of items that have some sort of shared attribute, and using `kulupu` to describe a group of anything is emphasizing that they have something in common. These shared qualities can be anything from location to color to desire.

#### kute

`kute` describes both passive hearing and active listening. It can also refer to things that hear, such as ears or microphones.

#### lape

The semantic space of `lape` contains sleep and rests. More abstractly, `lape` can mean anything from a short break from walking to a gap year in college, and less abstractly `lape` can mean a nap or sleeping. Using `lape` to describe an action often implies that the level of effort or involvement is lower when compared to surrounding activities.

#### laso

`laso` talks about both blues and greens at the same time. It can describe a large range of colors that are often separated in other languages, such as English. In English, blue and green are separate concepts with their own semantic space. In toki pona (as well as countless languages across the world), these concepts are merged into one. Many linguists affectionately call this color "grue" in the contexts of analyzing other languages, and the term can be helpful here because it gives a fantastic anchor for color perspective to English speakers. Think to yourself how often it is crucial to distinguish between blue and green. In cases where you wish to do so, greens are yellower than blues, so it's easy to modify `laso` with a word like "`jelo`" to specify that. But if you don't need to specify, doing so adds more clutter to your speaking. I wouldn't go much darker than cobalt blue before using `pimeja` instead. Because cool colors like `laso` tend to be darker a lot of the time, don't forget about `pimeja`.

Another part of `laso` worth mentioning is purples. While somewhat controversial, when I showed several toki ponists color chips (the kind you use when choosing which color to paint your wall), most of the darker or bluer shades of purple that were not dark enough to be `pimeja` were unanimously `laso`. Some of the lighter or pinker ones were called `loje`. There was also some overlap, and some people stated the importance of the surrounding colors. These are all things to keep in mind when you encounter a color that seems hard to talk about in toki pona. I'm often reminded of paints, and a purple like dioxazine violet would most definitely be `pimeja` and not `laso`.

#### lawa

The semantic space of `lawa` contains parts of a whole that control that whole, and the act of controlling itself. A classic example is the head of an animal, and perhaps by extension the heads of other things that just look similar. A tulip's flower could be a "`lawa`." Additionally, this can be taken a bit more abstractly. Someone who's in charge of a group could be considered the `lawa` of that group. Commanding troops in battle is a type of `lawa`. `lawa` doesn't imply any level of consent, so it could be forceful or gentle. Guiding a swimming student's body into the correct position for good technique could be `lawa`, but plenty of things that I'm not willing to describe could be `lawa` as well.

#### len

The semantic space of `len` contains both cloth and the act of hiding something. Any fabric or clothing can be `len`, for example, a shirt or a blanket. The pivot between "cloth" and "to hide something" is similar to covering something with a blanket. This meaning comes from the idea of applying a cloth to something to hide it. Both a hidden bird and a clothed bird could be a "waso len." `len` can also refer to secrecy or privacy and other qualities of being hidden.

#### lete

`lete` is the quality of coldness. If anything is cold, it is `lete`. `lete` is also occasionally used to describe raw food or unprocessed ore.

#### lili

The semantic space of `lili` contains all qualities of smallness relative to context. The thing that ties all things `lili` together is their relative size. A tall man might be `lili` compared to a mountain. A long speech may be `lili` compared to a novel. `lili` is a relative word, and therefore is always dependent on context.

#### linja

If it's long and you can tie it into a knot, it's `linja`. `linja` implies flexibility. By calling something `linja`, you are framing it as something that could be bent significantly, even if it can't. Let's say I call a metal bar a `linja`. I'm implying that to me, I can bend it easily, that to me it is flimsy. But most of the time, `linja` are things like string or cooked spaghetti. Dried spaghetti would not be a `linja` because it's brittle. If I draw a line, perhaps it can be `linja`, because even though it is drawn and cannot be moved around on the page, it might be representing something that could.

#### lipu

`lipu`'s semantic space is tied together by a piece of flat paper with writing on it. `lipu` can talk about both the texture and properties of that paper or the information contained on it, often both. For example, a document on a computer, while in no way as flimsy as paper, is still very much `lipu`. If you take the writing off of a piece of paper, it's just as much a `lipu`. Some speakers argue that this is an extended metaphor and by using `lipu` to describe these files, one is framing the computer as a `lipu`. For example, in Southeast Asia, language was written on dried palm leaves, which without writing are still `lipu`. In fact, many speakers use `lipu` for all leaves, be they large or small, without any implications of writing. Anything flat and flimsy can be a `lipu` for these speakers. As soon as it gets hard, it's likely to be a `supa` unless it has writing on it, though. For example, a Maya stele could be `lipu`, but a rock shaped like one with no writing on it would almost definitely not be.

#### loje

`loje` speaks to reddish colors and pigments. Cadmium reds all the way down to a darkish alizarin crimson. You can start mixing violet into `loje` for a while before it starts getting more `laso` or `pimeja`. You can also brighten it into orange and it can still be `loje`, but there's a gray area between `loje` and `jelo` that I encourage learners to play around with.

#### lon

For many people, `lon` is core to the philosophy of toki pona. It's a key example that ties together the physical and metaphysical. `lon` is existence, `lon` is truth, `lon` is reality. `lon` is not only existing at a place, but also existing during a time, or in a context. `lon`'s usage outside of a preposition mostly derives from this meaning of existing.

#### luka

`luka` is an organ capable of manipulation, or a part of said organ. For example, an arm is a `luka`, and so is a hand, fingers, and even elbows. The main part is that it interacts with other things. If a cat's paw is swiping at me, I might use `luka` to describe it, but if it's just walking on it I might not (see: `noka`), but I still could. So, it's possible for one organ to be both a `luka` and something else in different contexts. The prehensile tails of some monkeys could be `luka` too, especially while they're using them, but the only thing something needs in order to be a `luka` is an innate ability to interact with objects. `luka` can also be used as a verb to refer to this interaction with its direct object, which could be touching, petting, pressing, pulling, holding, hugging, grasping, playing an instrument, etc. I'm sure you can think of other things it could mean. `luka` is also commonly used to describe talking using a signed language.

#### lukin

`lukin` is both passive seeing and active watching. It can also mean something that sees, like eyes or a camera. `lukin` is also used as a preverb that means to "try" to do something.

#### lupa

A `lupa` is a hole. Here's what that means: these holes can go through objects, like the hole in a donut, or they can be an indentation in an object, such as a hole dug in the ground. Things that are `lupa` continue to be `lupa` even when there is something blocking them, like a door or a window because they are still meant for things to pass through them. From a perspective of function, that's what `lupa` are for. A `lupa` is a part of an object that things can pass through. A door is still a `lupa` because people can open it, and a window is still a `lupa` because it's meant for light to pass through. Empty space is not a `lupa` because it's not part of an object. The semantic space can be extended to describe other things that fit this description, even if they aren't physical holes, such as portals or links on the internet. You can read more about `lupa` here.

#### ma

`ma` is a place or location. This can be a physical one, like a country or spot on the ground. It's far more common to see `ma` used to talk about grounded locations, but it's also used to talk about anything from a tree branch something's on or even an airplane miles or kilometers above the ground. `ma` can sometimes be the ground itself, like dirt or rocks, or even an entire planet with a hard surface. Don't confuse `ma` with `kiwen` though, because `ma` has connotations of location and ground that `kiwen` doesn't.

#### mama

A `mama` is a parent, ancestor, caretaker, or creator. My great-great-great-grandparent can be a `mama` to me, even if I never even met them. Just the same, an uncle, an aunt, or a cousin could all be `mama`, but if I'm an adult and I'm talking about my baby cousin, I'm probably not going to call them `mama`. `mama` is somewhat about hierarchy, but it isn't about power. It's about caretaking. This doesn't always have to do with age. A worker at a nursing home could be a `mama`. Another fun example of `mama` is a tree that bears fruit. If all of the seeds are its children, then the tree could be `mama`. Thinking about `mama` like this can be fun and allows a lot of freedom in exploring its semantic space.

#### mani

`mani` speaks to things used in trade, such as fiat money, livestock, spices, or anything else being framed as a tool of bartering. Anything can be `mani`, but by using `mani` for it you're throwing most of its other qualities to the side. For example, if I use `mani` to describe coriander, I am framing its culinary usage as irrelevant. I do not care if it will be cooked with. I only care that it will be used in an exchange.

#### mi

`mi` talks about the speaker. It can also refer to groups that include the speaker. Similarly to `sina`, when quoting others, it doesn't necessarily refer to the one who is speaking at the moment, and instead refers to the one being quoted. But besides situations like that, `mi` always includes the speaker.

#### mije` and `meli

The semantic space of `mije` contains men and masculinity. The semantic space of `meli` contains women and femininity. These words are as well defined as the concepts they represent, so it's left intentionally broad without specifying further. This means that for beings that can talk to you, they decide if they fit within the semantic space of either of these words.

#### moku

`moku` is food. `moku` is also eating that same food. In fact, anything that can be eaten can be `moku`. Even if it's not edible, you can use `moku` to describe it. Doing so implies that it is in some context eaten, though, so be careful. There's a quote from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005). "Everything here is edible; even I'm edible. But that, dear children, is cannibalism, and is in fact frowned upon in most societies." Use this ancient wisdom from two decades ago to guide your `moku` usage.

#### moli

`moli` means death, but what does death mean? Sometimes, `moli` describes a kind of destruction that cannot be undone. Death is permanent. But other times, `moli` can describe harm or destruction that comes to a treasured object. In these situations, there is still usually a sense of permanency. "ilo mi li moli" would probably be interpreted as "my phone is broken," or even "my phone is broken beyond repair," but probably not "my phone is out of battery." That doesn't mean that `moli` inherently means that there is no possible way to undo the destruction. For example, if resurrection was real, I might still use `moli` for death anyway. Many cultures believe in reincarnation, life after death, or some sort of returning to nature. Perhaps in these frameworks, `moli` still describes permanence, but it's not inherently negative.

#### mu

The semantic space of `mu` contains noises coming from things being framed as living. A lion's roar is `mu`. A cough is `mu`. Humans are animals, but often when they say things, we can understand them, so we might choose to use a different word over `mu`. But `mu` is often used to describe languages and vocalizations that are not understood by the speaker. Adjacently, many people describe non-language vocalizations as `mu`, such as coughs, sneezes, or vocal stims.

By using `mu` to describe a noise, you are ascribing some level of livingness to the thing that produced it. Using `mu` to describe a robot's noise makes the robot feel more like a living thing. This can be taken to any extreme, and it often ends up seeming humorous. For example, the sound of some sizzling bacon could be a `mu`, which is thought-provoking. But the sound of a waterfall can also be `mu`, which is thought-provoking in a completely different way. Ascribing qualities of life and animacy to bacon and waterfalls are very different situations. With bacon, it becomes a joke, where the punchline is that `mu` is an "animal noise" and sizzling is an "animal noise." But with a waterfall, it becomes a deep philosophical musing about what life is.

Using `mu` to describe the vocalizations of animals is usually a safe bet, but using it in other circumstances can be very profound.

#### mun

Across the sky are many objects, some of which move quickly or slowly and some of which seem to be fixed in place. The moon, the stars, the planets, even the sun. All of these objects fit within `mun`'s semantic space, especially the ones that are most obvious at night. If you brought a star down to earth, it would still be `mun`, so things like `mun` Kekan San, who is a shining star, are `mun` as well. If you left earth and visited a `mun`, it would still be a `mun`, so Mars from the perspective of a rover might still be `mun`. The big question here is that to that Mars rover, is earth `mun`? And then again, to us, is earth a `mun`? That's for you to find out.

#### musi

The semantic space of `musi` contains all things funny, entertaining, enticing, and interesting. An enjoyable book is `musi`. A good joke is `musi`. A game is `musi`. A documentary about fish is `musi`. The act of enjoying something or just enjoying oneself is `musi`. Some speakers disagree about whether something serious like a documentary about the Holocaust can be `musi`. I encourage discussion about this because I don't have a good answer at the moment.

#### mute

There's an old running joke that I take with me everywhere: toki ponists can't tell apart numbers above two. Whenever one of my professors asks a question about "how many" of something there are, I always say "like three," whether that be tubes of paint or languages in the world or measures in a Bach chorale. `mute` doesn't specify a huge or small number. A few, several, a lot, and a ton are all `mute`. Usually, in context, it's easy to tell these amounts apart. `mute` as a noun means "amount" and as a verb it can mean either "multiply" or "divide." If I cut a `kili` into pieces, now I have many `kili`, and if I cast a spell to multiply a `kili` into multiple `kili`, I have many `kili`, so either way it doesn't matter. Unless it does matter, in which case, ask yourself: why does it matter? The answer to that question will guide you on disambiguating efficiently. `mute` is used as a general intensifier too when modifying some sort of quality or another modifier.

#### nanpa

`nanpa` refers to numbers. Some examples of numbers could be phone numbers, HP in a video game, heart rate, or blood sugar. `nanpa` can also refer to things related to computers because most things computers do are really lots of little numbers. Some people like to use `nanpa` for math in general, but everyone I know who's into math doesn't like considering all math as numbers. Some math is numbers, and that math can be `nanpa`, but other math isn't. It's your decision where you stand on that.

#### nasa

The semantic space of `nasa` contains deviations from what's considered normal. If most people have blue hair and one person has green hair, that one person is `nasa`. If someone grows ten types of herbs and a single carnivorous plant, then that carnivorous plant is `nasa`. If most people don't grow herbs, someone who does grow herbs is `nasa`. What's considered "normal" here is completely reliant on context. A clown isn't `nasa` if everyone around them is also a clown. Nothing is inherently `nasa`. The `nasa`-ness of all objects will change along with context.

#### nasin

`nasin` ties together method and path. Physically, a `nasin` is a path or direction one follows, a road you can drive along, any way to reach a location, or perhaps even to wander. Metaphysically, `nasin` refers to a way to live your life, a way to make something, or any other method. Just as easily as Main Street can be a `nasin`, so can communism or the pomodoro technique or setting an alarm or Islam. It doesn't need a specific destination, but there's usually some purpose to it.

#### nena

`nena` describes parts of a surface that stick out from the parts around it. For example, a button on a computer keyboard could be a `nena`. A knot in a tree could be a `nena`. Small toes can be `nena`. Fingers are probably too long to be `nena`, but if you use `nena` for them, you're framing them as bumps as opposed to long objects or a grasping organ. `nena` can be dull or sharp. A speed bump can be a `nena` and a hill can be a `nena`, but so can a spike or a sharp peak of a mountain. Some `nena` are pleasant to touch, and others might draw blood. If I wanted to make a `nena` no longer a `nena`, all I'd need to do is smooth it into the rest of the surface it's part of such that it no longer bulges out.

Another important part of `nena`'s semantic space is its usage for the nose. The nose is a bump, which is why `nena` can describe it, but as a transitive verb, `nena` becomes rapidly useful to describe active smelling. Wafting the aroma of roasting chicken can be a type of `nena`, as an action, but it's drawing attention to the nose. It makes the agent (i.e. the one that smells) a key part of the situation.

#### ni

`ni` is similar to "this," "that," and "yonder" in English. It is used in two different contexts. The easiest way to use `ni` is to point at a physical object. This could be demonstrated with a finger, a gesture of the head, a glance, or even a drawn arrow. In those contexts, the semantic space of "ni" is that thing you're pointing at. You can also use `ni` as a modifier to be more specific. Are you pointing at a specific box? You can say "poki ni." Are you pointing at a specific location? "ma ni" works just as well as "ni." What about the current situation? "tenpo ni" is perfect for this.

Extended into the metaphorical, `ni` can also be used to point at things you or others have said. It always stands in for at least one clause (a clause is any phrase with a verb in it). Most often you'll see it standing in for a previous or upcoming sentence.

`ni` can also be used as a modifier to elaborate on a word in a sentence. If your sentences are getting too long, `ni` is among the easiest ways to break it up. You can turn "mi wile e soweli pi linja pi suwi mute" into "mi wile e soweli ni: linja ona li suwi mute." Note how "ona" in the next sentence stands in for "soweli ni." If you want to learn more about this, look into anaphora and deixis.

toki pona lacks proximity distinctions, unlike English. In English, the difference between "this," "that," and "yonder" is how close the object is to the speaker and listener. toki pona's "ni" can fill the meaning of any of these. It is more general, but you can usually tell what it's talking about due to context. If you're worried that people might not be able to tell where something is, you can say how close it is by using "poka" and "weka," among other tools.

#### nimi

`nimi` are words and names. "lipamanka" is a `nimi`. "paralelepípedo" is a `nimi`. "cupcake" is a `nimi`. This description of `nimi`'s semantic space is "nimi".

#### noka

The semantic space of `noka` contains the bottom parts of things meant for touching the ground. Some basic examples of `noka` might be feet or legs. `noka` can refer to the bottom part of a piece of furniture or the wheels of a car. The lowest floor of a building is `noka`. The roots of a tree are `noka`. `noka` can also refer to the action of applying a `noka` to something, such as kicking, stepping on, and walking on. If you use `noka` for this, you'll be framing the relationship as some sort of application of a `noka` onto the direct object.

#### olin

`olin` describes the act of being emotionally bonded to someone or something. In usage, these bonds are typically positive and strong. For example, a very good friend, a partner, a family member, or a pet. Not only could the love for a very good friend be `olin`, but so can the friend. This can be used with objects too. The bond between many toki ponists and the language toki pona is `olin`. This isn't the same thing as liking something. By using `olin`, you are evoking some sort of emotional bond. Note that `olin` doesn't describe all emotional bonds between two things. So if I don't like someone a lot but I still respect them deeply, I could still use `olin` to describe the respect, but probably not how I don't like them. Using `olin` for respect is a less common usage.

#### ona

`ona` is the only third-person pronoun in toki pona. Unlike `ni`, `ona` is seldom used except to point at objects from previous sentences, i.e. toki ponists don't usually use it to talk about things they're pointing at. `ona` has no animacy connotation, just as no toki pona word does (except for maybe `jan`). `ona` can just as easily refer to a block of wood or a doorknob as it can to a human or animal. It also has no gender connotation, just like every other toki pona word, so it can just as easily mean he or she.

#### open

`open` describes activation. If I activate a light switch, that can be `open`. If I open a door, that can be `open` as well. `open` often describes something's function being activated, but it can also describe the beginning of an event, like the start of a concert or the start of a year. Perhaps childhood could be `open`. The throughline here is cause and effect. The act of `open` is always a cause, but `open` can also be the event around that activation. This activation usually isn't a type of creation and serves to exist within the function of the activated thing.

#### pakala

`pakala` describes destruction. `pakala` is often not intended, for example, a mistake. The thing being destroyed was your expectations. Sometimes, when people's expectations are destroyed, they say "pakala" by itself to describe said destruction, similar to the way expletives work in other languages. This isn't something special that `pakala` does, but `pakala` is used this way because the situations we swear in are often situations where we've made mistakes or when something has been destroyed. `pakala` can also be intentional, such as smash therapy or the intentional use of explosions. `pakala` can also describe harm. If something cut my skin, I might use `pakala` to describe that. In fact, `pakala` merges the ideas of harm and destruction. In English, these concepts are given separate words, but in toki pona, they aren't.

#### pali

`pali` is work. But what does that mean? In toki pona, `pali` needs at least a little bit of effort, and it needs to make a little bit of something. But if it only had a little of each, calling it "pali" might be a worse choice than using another word. Just because eating requires a little work and makes energy inside of your body doesn't mean `pali` will be understood. So almost always, `pali` will either require a lot of effort or create a significant thing. A professional potter making pottery might not require a lot of effort because they are skilled enough, but it will create a significant object. And on the reverse, learning a new language may not create a significant object (just some new knowledge in your head), but it does require a lot of effort.

#### palisa

The semantic space of `palisa` contains all things that are longer than they are wide that are not flexible enough to be bent significantly. Any `palisa` will resist bending and either break or only bend slightly under significant pressure. If a `palisa` is looked at from a different perspective where there is enough power to bend it, it might not firmly sit within `palisa`'s semantic space. A good test that works most of the time is to check to see if it’s flexible enough to be bent into a 0-degree angle or if it’s flexible enough to be tied in a knot; if it is, then it’s probably not a `palisa`.

#### pan

`pan` is a starchy staple food such as rice, wheat, barley, teff, potato, and corn. `pan` can also refer to products made from these, such as bread and porridges. More specific examples include injera, fufu, pasta, tteokbokki, tortillas, cakes, congee, and cereal. Many speakers will use `pan` to describe corn products like corn flakes but won't use it to describe corn on the cob. A less common usage of `pan` refers to legumes as well as grains and their products such as tempeh, natto, and tofu. Other plant-based foods are almost never called `pan` unless they resemble food usually made of grains, like a zucchini pancake might still be `pan` even though it doesn't have any grain in it. Foods with a type of `pan` as their primary ingredient can be called `pan` as a whole, such as poke, ramen, gyro, or a burrito, even if they have a lot of non-`pan` components.

#### pana

The semantic space of `pana` contains all acts that set objects in motion. This can be a type of emission. The act of a fire giving off heat is `pana`. The act of a child laughing is `pana` because the child is emitting laughter, setting it in motion. Throwing a baseball, hitting a hockey puck, and kicking a football (the kind that Americans call a "soccer ball") are all `pana`. Defenestration is a type of `pana` because you are setting something in motion (out a window). The object that does the act of `pana` doesn't have to set something in motion away from itself. Buying a piano online for a friend is `pana`, or at the very least the act of having the piano delivered is `pana`. Less physical objects can be the subject of `pana` too: knowledge, advice, or good feelings (bad ones, too!).

#### pilin

`pilin` is some sort of sensory qualia. `pilin` can refer just as easily to internal senses as it can to external ones, so `pilin` can mean both touch and emote. Most speakers use `pilin` to mean "opinion" as well, framing an opinion as some sort of internal sensory experience.

#### pimeja

The semantic space of `pimeja` contains types of darkness. This could talk about specific colors like deep red or dark emerald green, but it can also talk about shadows, places where there is less light, or the absence of brighter colors. `pimeja` can describe anything that is dark. From some perspectives, the night is a type of darkness more than a period of time (just as a day can be a type of brightness and a year can be a type of circle).

#### pini

`pini` is the moment something comes to a close. This can be as simple as a door shutting or a light turning off, but it can be more abstract, like a department at a college fizzling out. `pini` has no connotations of irreversibility.

#### pipi

`pipi` tend to be on the smaller side. They can have legs, and their legs will be under them. They usually have six or more legs if they have any at all. When they move quickly, they will usually move in straight lines, whether that be across a surface or through the air. Sometimes, they don't have legs. `pipi` tend to be squishy inside, and if there's a hard part, it will be on the outside. This is similar to the concept of an exoskeleton.

#### poka

`poka` is at its core anything, either an object or location, that is nearby or to the side of something else. This could be the space next to someone, or at the side of someone, such as the left-hand side of a walking person. But this can also be part of an object, such as someone's hips or a car door. Extended into the metaphorical space, `poka` becomes extremely useful for talking about relationships. toki ponists tend to place people and objects they have relationships with in proximity with them, so one might describe a friend as `poka` and a loose acquaintance as not `poka`. Two things don't have to be physically next to each other in order to be "lon poka."

#### poki

`poki` are containers. They're meant to contain things. Bags, boxes, and bins are great examples of `poki`. Furniture that contains things, such as trash cans, drawers, shelves, and even closets, are a big part of `poki`. Some `poki` might be metaphysical rather than physical. All semantic spaces of all toki pona words can be framed as `poki`, containing possible meanings. You could look at labels through this lens, and people who choose to use a label are placing themselves within the semantic space of said label. This usage of `poki` is fairly common.

#### pona

`pona` is a biased word. It defines toki pona's design goals and names them as good. "pona" can be any good quality, but to truly understand `pona`, one must understand the reason behind each decision made when creating toki pona. This is why in toki pona it's so easy to call the language "toki pona" - it's the language that most closely fits the design goals, which are also the semantic space of the word "pona." You'll seldom see speakers who disagree with this and describe toki pona as not `pona`, but that's because most of the people who don't like toki pona's design don't speak it very well if at all.

#### sama

`sama` can be all qualities of similarities and samenesses. Two siblings are `sama` because they have a parent in common. Two stringed instruments are `sama` because they both have strings. Two action figures of the same exact character are `sama`.

#### seli

`seli` is heat. If something's hot or giving off heat, it's `seli`. The heat itself is also `seli`. This word can also be used to talk about spicy food through metaphor because spicy food literally makes your mouth feel warmer, but be careful not to calque English by explaining that if you use `seli` like that. Household appliances used to heat food can be `seli`, like a stovetop. `seli` can be used as a verb to mean "cook," if in English you see cooking as always some sort of application of heat. Chopping up vegetables to put in a raw salad isn't a good example of `seli`.

#### selo

`selo` describes the outer layer of an object. It doesn't matter what the object is. For example, skin can be `selo`, and bark can be `selo`. This can get extended into the metaphorical. What are outer layers for? Usually, they protect that which is inside. Perhaps an attempt to ignore bigotry could be described as a `selo`. But in doing so, you're framing it as an outer layer of your mind. `selo` don't always have to contain anything important, even though they usually do. Balloons are usually empty (save for air) and they can still be `selo`. In fact, a vacuum chamber's walls could be `selo`, even though they literally have nothing inside. As a verb, `selo` can mean "to surround fully," or "to become the outer layer of (something)." Some people use this for hugging, which is very fun.

#### seme

The semantic space of `seme` is unknown. That's the whole point! When one uses `seme`, it's unclear what it means. It is an invitation for an answer. This is very similar to wh-words in English like "what," "which," and "who." Unlike English, toki pona only has the one. If you want to specify what your query is about, you can modify a different word with `seme`. "kasi seme" can mean "which plant," for example. Often, `seme` is a direct prompt to the listener, but it's frequently used as a prompt to the self or an expression of a lack of knowledge. Speakers sometimes ask a question with `seme` only to answer it.

#### sewi

`sewi` embodies a very powerful conceptual metaphor that exists within toki pona. In toki pona, upwards and high things and divinity are connected. These are two separate ideas that `sewi` connects by referring to both of them. Things that are religious or sacred can be `sewi`. For example, a religion could be "nasin sewi," religious art can be "sitelen sewi", and a god, practitioner, or religious wisdom holder can all be "jan sewi." `sewi` on its own can easily refer to that which is divine or worshipped. But `sewi` very simply talks about the space above something. "sewi kiwen" can mean "the space above the rock" or "the top of the rock." Keep in mind that all of these examples can work in the other sense of `sewi`. "nasin sewi" can mean an upward direction, "sitelen sewi" can be the top painting of two paintings, and "jan sewi" can be someone who just climbed a big mountain. And of course, "sewi kiwen" could be the divinity of a rock.

#### sijelo

`sijelo` is the substance of something. It's the stuff. We're all made out of physical matter, and `sijelo` is that matter and the material it's made up of. Many speakers use `sijelo` as a modifier to mean "physical." For example, "lon sijelo" could mean "IRL" (as opposed to something like "lon ilo" to mean "online").

#### sike

`sike` represents round objects and cycles. `sike` can be used to refer to the smoothness of an edge. `sike` can be used to talk about marbles and flat disks such as cookies. `sike` can talk about wheels or balls or even gyroscopes. Because `sike` can also represent cycles, it can be used to describe a repeated action. "toki sike" could be repeating the same thing over and over again. "utala sike" could be a never-ending cycle of war or some online discourse that just won't end. Whether it's physical or not, a `sike` will always loop around and end where it started.

#### sin

`sin` means "new" or "again." It's almost always clear from context which of those two `sin` means. I recommend paying attention to `sin`'s usage in the wild to try to figure out if it's ever ambiguous between new and again. The reason why it isn't is that the difference between those two concepts isn't very far. It doesn't matter if you've done it before. In toki pona, something can be new even if it isn't the first time it's happened.

`sin` can mean a lot of things, and that range of possibility is given by explaining what something is new to. Children are new to this world, toki pona learners are new to toki pona communities, a new brand of soda is new to the free market economy which we all love so much, etc. These can all be `sin`.

#### sina

`sina` is the listener, reader, the one who interprets what the speaker says, or any group that contains them. Similarly to `mi`, when quoting others, it doesn't necessarily refer to the one who is listening at the moment, and instead refers to the one listening from when the quote is from. But besides situations like that, `sina` always includes the listener. Many people also use `sina` as a general hypothetical pronoun, similar to "one" in English when used as a pronoun. Others use `sina` when talking to inanimate objects. Perhaps this frames the object as listening. I recommend playing around with this at least a little bit.

#### sinpin

`sinpin` refers to objects that face directions. Walls can easily be `sinpin`, and so can human faces or any of the front part of an animal. The part of a building that faces the road can be `sinpin`.

`sinpin` can't be extended into a metaphorical space to talk about time. "tenpo sinpin" might mean future or past to people from different cultures, so in order to use it like that, you'd need to build it up by explaining the metaphor. For example, if you framed yourself as facing the past and walking backwards, you could even use "tenpo sinpin" to talk about the past.

#### sitelen

`sitelen` are depictions, such as images or symbols. A painting or a photograph is both `sitelen`. It's also common to see `sitelen` used to describe a symbol in a writing system. The letter q and the Maya glyph for b'alam (jaguar) are both `sitelen`. `sitelen` is usually used for things that were created, but these don't need to be organized. A random scribble is still a `sitelen` even though it doesn't necessarily represent anything. Pure random noise has the potential to be a `sitelen` too, but doing so will likely frame the noise as having some sort of order to it. Perhaps it was chosen? Maybe it's being used for something? Maybe it's a mistake? Explore `sitelen`.

#### sona

The semantic space of `sona` contains all knowledge. If something is knowable or known, it is `sona`. For example, the knowledge of time of day can be `sona`. Wisdom can be `sona`. `sona` can also be a skill. The knowledge of how to write a book can certainly be `sona`. Knowing about a person or who they are can be `sona`. A person's memory can be `sona`. If I were to describe information on a computer as "`sona`," I would be framing it as being known by the computer. A warning to English-speaking learners: the type of knowledge that `sona` covers doesn't completely contain the English concept of "knowing someone." For that, it might be a better idea to explain what your relationship with that person is in more detail.

#### soweli

`soweli` describes creatures with several distinctive traits. `soweli` tend to be fluffy. `soweli` tend to be larger than a plum. Their legs tend to be under them, and they tend to have four of them. When they want to move quickly, they run on their legs, with moments where all legs are off the ground. They are warm to the touch.

#### suli

`suli` is big, tall, wide, vast, deep, etc. Any physical dimension of largeness can be `suli`. toki pona doesn't use different words to distinguish different ways of being big. In the metaphysical of toki pona, if something is big that means it is important, so `suli` can also mean important. `suli` could mean that something is made up of a lot of stuff, often implying that it's complex. `suli` can talk about necessity. If something is crucial, it is `suli`. Combining `suli` with perspectives can show what people value, allowing us to construct a map of what matters more or less to others. "seme li suli tawa seme?"

#### suno

`suno` is an object that emits light or the light itself. It can be brightness or a shimmer or a sparkle. The sun is a `suno`, a lamp is a `suno`, but sunlight and lamplight are also `suno`. Many people use `suno` by itself to mean a day cycle, framing a day as a type of light. This kind of framing is interesting because it doesn't sit right with all speakers, but it's understandable, so speakers can learn more about how each other see the world this way.

#### supa

`supa` permeates all of our lives. Notice all the flat objects around you. You use them every day. You sleep on one, you work on one, you eat at one, you cook at one. One important aspect of `supa` is that things can rest upon it. Here's a good test you can try out to tell if something is `supa`: if I were to start tilting a `supa` on its side ever so slowly, it would cease to be `supa` as soon as things fell off of it. That means that a surface with very high friction (like felt) can continue to be `supa` for longer than something with very low friction (like a flat sheet of Teflon). If you have stuck things to a surface and turn it completely upside down, it can stay a `supa`.

#### suwi

`suwi` describes pleasant aspects of the senses. If something is pleasant to the mouth, i.e. it is sweet, that is `suwi`. If something is pleasant to the eye, i.e. cute, that is `suwi` as well. The scent of apples might be `suwi` as well. A soft or fuzzy texture can be `suwi`. A pleasant sound can be described as `suwi`. `suwi` can also describe other pleasant things, such as actions or people. Like if someone bakes you a pie, not only is the pie usually `suwi`, but so is the act of making it. Note that `suwi` isn't used for savory pleasant flavors much, usually just sweet ones.

#### tan

`tan` is some sort of point of origin. It can be a place or object, like a birthing parent or the source of a river, but it can also be a reason like a thrilling feeling or the fear of being yelled at. This corresponds with `tan`'s use as a preposition, where it marks this point of origin, i.e. the word directly after prepositional `tan` is also some sort of point of origin in the same exact way.

#### taso

`taso` doesn't actually change the semantic space of a word it modifies. Instead, it trims away the possibility of other things filling the role of that object in a sentence. `taso` says that only the word it modifies does whatever it does. It's almost the inverse of `ala` in that instead of canceling out the semantic space of everything before it that it modifies, it cancels out everything else. `taso` is also used as a conjunction at the beginning of a sentence, meaning something similar to "but" in English.

#### tawa

`tawa` is motion. `tawa` frequently has a destination, and when used as a preposition, it marks the word after it as this destination. A destination isn't critical to `tawa` though; speakers will use `tawa` for vibrating or shaking in place or wandering. When `tawa` is used as a preposition, it marks that which the motion approaches. This can be physical, but metaphysically `tawa` can mark a recipient, beneficiary, point of perspective, etc.

#### telo

`telo` can be liquids and other things that don’t hold a shape. Water, milk, and vinegar are `telo`. `telo` can be more viscous. Oils are `telo`. `telo` can be used less literally, to describe things that aren’t physical objects. The changing aspect of a way of speaking toki pona that doesn’t stay the same can be `telo`. If something changes form and doesn’t hold its shape, it fits within `telo`’s semantic space.

#### tenpo

You'll usually hear people say that `tenpo` means "time." But what does that mean? What even is the abstract concept of time? This definition isn't very useful, so a different angle I suggest people take is to look at `tenpo` as either a situation or a duration. `tenpo` could be that one time I robbed a bank, or all the times I cooked with schmaltz. `tenpo` could be a minute, an hour, or an eon (1 billion years). `tenpo` can be the time when the sun shines, the cycle it takes for the earth to rotate around the sun, or for the earth to rotate such that the sun goes away and comes back. `tenpo` can be the time when it's dark, the time when it's cold or warm, the time it takes for the moon to go through all its phases, the time it takes for markets to set up and disband a few times a week, the time when we work, the time when we sleep, the time when we travel, or the time when we arrive. `tenpo` can talk about the abstract concept of time, but usually it is used to talk about specific events, situations, and durations.

#### toki

The semantic space of `toki` contains any form or act of communication. This can be communication using the mouth, such as spoken language, or communication using the hands, such as signed languages. This could be communication using a written medium. `toki` doesn't have to just be for humans. Bee dances are `toki`. `toki` doesn't have to be between two parties either. Communication with one's self (such as someone thinking or talking to themselves) is `toki`. `toki` can get very abstract. If I can feel the atmospheric pressure change and I can detect that it's probably going to rain later because I'm old, I could say that the sky is `toki`-ing to me. If I read a sign, the action that sign is doing can be `toki`.

#### tomo

A `tomo` contains objects meant to contain things being framed as living. Sometimes living is literal. A family of five is considered living, so their domicile can be considered a `tomo`. Sometimes living is a metaphor. A dollhouse can be considered a `tomo` if the hypothetical dolls it can contain are being framed as living, even if they aren't empirically alive. By calling a container intended for nonliving things a "tomo", a speaker is ascribing life to those objects. There's no animacy hierarchy in toki pona, so what is and isn't considered life is up to personal preference and doesn't impact mutual intelligibility.

#### tu

`tu` is, at its core, an act of separation. In toki pona, if there are two of something, one is framing them as separate. You don't need to modify a word with `tu` in order for there to be two of it, so using `tu` is saying something: I am separating these two things. "kili tu" can evoke an importance between two heads of lettuce. `tu` is used frequently as a verb to mean "cut" or "divide." It can be used for cutting something into more than two pieces because `tu` doesn't specify a specific number of times. Like "mi tu e kili" could describe four separate cuts, which could be up to 16 pieces. `tu` can also be metaphysical, describing divorce or any type of distance between people or objects with enough context. Some other good examples of `tu` are splitting up a class into two groups or drawing the boundaries between two subparts of a large piece of land, potentially in a colonial context.

#### unpa

`unpa`'s semantic space has to do with sex and sexual activity. The number of participants doesn't matter; solo masturbation is equally as valid to describe as `unpa` as an orgy, as is anything in between. Kink can be a part of `unpa`, but it is specifically framed as a part of sex, whether in the lead-up as in foreplay, in the act, or any other part of sex. For comparison, horniness and other feelings or concepts related to sex are generally not called `unpa`, but they are often considered in their relationship to sex. Additionally, sexual positions and sexual preferences are generally not `unpa`, as they are not the act. However, they may be framed in their relationship to sex, such as by the use of the word `unpa` as a modifier.

Gender and biological sex do not play a role in `unpa`'s semantic space; put another way, `unpa` doesn't change when the identities of those involved change. It is still `unpa`.

Reproduction also generally does not play a role in `unpa`'s semantic space, a feature it shares with the word "sex" describing the act but not reproduction. Reproduction may be referenced in relation to `unpa`, such as when discussing breeding animals, but `unpa` generally does not imply or refer to reproduction on its own. There are caveats to this however; some speakers will use `unpa` to refer to pollination, one of the means by which plants reproduce. By the use of `unpa`, this is being framed as a sexual act at the same time as an act of reproduction; this is by analogy to sex, as pollination is the closest similar thing that applies to plants.

#### uta

`uta` is a mouth or oral opening. Astomatous objects do not have `uta`, but all other objects do. By using `uta` to describe something, you are framing it with all the connotations of an animal's mouth. The mouth of a Venus flytrap could very easily be something else, but using `uta` for it emphasizes that it consumes. `uta` often creates noises like vocalizations, so people tend to call voice chats and spoken language "`toki uta`."

#### utala

The semantic space of `utala` contains conflicts, contests, and battles. When `utala` is used, it’s talking about some sort of struggle or competition between two or more parties or something being framed that way. So it could be a battle between two rival armies, but it could also be a battle between me and myself if I’m framing it that way. `utala` is often targeted, closer to “attack” than “battle.” Anything can be an `utala` if it is being framed as a struggle or attack of some sort that involves two parties. Playing a musical instrument could be an `utala` for a beginner player. Taking a test is a very fun thing to call an `utala` because the test-taker is fighting the test.

#### walo

`walo` is any bright color like white, pink, light blue, etc.

#### wan

It is best to think about `wan` as first and foremost some type of union. Other objects are coming together into one whole. That kind of motion is core to the word "wan." The number meaning is secondary. `wan` is used frequently to mean combine, marry, mix, overlap, etc. Using `wan` as a modifier can indeed mean that there is only one of something, but it's always good to think about it as a single unified whole.

#### waso

`waso` are creatures. They almost always have wings, and when they want to move quickly, they use those wings to propel them forward. They frequently have feathers. They have two legs that they use to walk on land. `waso` usually lay eggs and often (but not always) sing. Many speakers use `waso` to refer to things like planes that aren't living creatures, which has been especially common in meetups, where the flight itself and the plane are both called `waso`. This usage is controversial though. `waso` can be used to refer to birds that don't fly or use their wings to fly, such as ostriches, kiwi birds, or penguins, and doing so shows the way you split up the animal kingdom. There are quite a few speakers who don't use `waso` for these creatures, and that shows the way we split up the animal kingdom too.

#### wawa

`wawa` is the quality of power and strength. A very strong person is `wawa`. The strength required to talk to new people one has never met before is `wawa`. `wawa` focuses less on the ability or possibility itself and more on the power and motivation behind it. `wawa` belongs to things with agency. If something is enabled, it is `wawa`. For example, if a lightbulb has been turned on, it becomes `wawa`. `wawa` is used frequently to refer to energy itself, both in an abstract sense (such as spoons or motivation) and in a physical sense, such as electricity or force. Many people aren't `wawa` until they drink their morning coffee. The coffee makes them `wawa`.

Another great angle of "wawa" is the concept of saturation and concentration. For example, a strong drink (as in, one that has a lot of alcohol) is `wawa`, but as you dilute it with water, it becomes less `wawa`. Another example is paint. Saturated paint mixed with a neutral shade of paint (like gray, black, or white) will slowly and slowly become less `wawa`. Depending on how salty water is, one could describe it as `wawa`, for example, if comparing saltwater fish to freshwater fish.

#### weka

`weka` describes distance. It is similar to other location words in that it can describe a place, but instead of describing a specific relation to proximity, it describes the lack thereof. Hence, `weka` describes a place that is not nearby. This could be outside a house or simply outside of reality. It can describe the act of disappearing or vanishing. Transitively, it can mean the act of removal or stealing. `weka` can also be more passive as an action, such as ignoring, just as easily as it can be an active action like getting rid of something.

#### wile

The semantic space of `wile` contains all desires. A desire to eat is a `wile`. A desire to be near others is a `wile`. These desires can be influenced by external forces: a desire to do tedious chores motivated by the prospect of negative consequences is a `wile`. By using `wile` to describe something, it's being framed as a type of desire. For example, if I normally don't want to tidy up my workspace but I feel obligated to anyway, if I used `wile` to describe that feeling of obligation, I'd be describing it as some sort of desire. This can be used for anything, no matter how animate. Speakers frame nonliving objects as having desires very frequently.

A warning I have for `wile` is assuming it contains the idea of a "need." A "need" is a complex concept and trying to use `wile` to describe it is misguided. While most needs can be framed as types of desires, the goal of "wile" isn't to merge those concepts, it's to throw one of them away. This enables a toki ponist to align their desires with their actions by giving them a word to describe their desires without any complex connotation. Sometimes it's more useful to say "my body wants food, but I don't want to eat."
